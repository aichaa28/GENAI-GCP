How many people are affected by malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy ?,"MMPSI is a rare condition. Although its prevalence is unknown, approximately 100 cases have been described in the medical literature.","Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is an extremely rare epilepsy syndrome.  While the exact prevalence is unknown, the current medical literature describes approximately 100 cases worldwide.  This suggests that the actual number of affected individuals may be slightly higher, as some cases may go undiagnosed or unreported in the literature.  Therefore, while we can say that MMPSI affects a very small number of infants, a precise quantification remains elusive.",0.7994,0.3077,0.1573,0.2637,6.2254
Is Galloway-Mowat syndrome inherited ?,"How is Galloway-Mowat syndrome inherited? Galloway-Mowat syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier","Yes, Galloway-Mowat syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.  This means an affected individual inherits two mutated copies of a gene associated with the syndrome, one from each parent. The parents are typically carriers, meaning they possess one mutated copy and one normal copy of the gene, and are usually unaffected.",0.9144,0.407,0.2235,0.2907,3.2484
What are the treatments for Weill-Marchesani syndrome ?,These resources address the diagnosis or management of Weill-Marchesani syndrome:  - Gene Review: Gene Review: Weill-Marchesani Syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Weill-Marchesani syndrome  - Genetic Testing Registry: Weill-Marchesani syndrome 1  - Genetic Testing Registry: Weill-Marchesani syndrome 2  - Genetic Testing Registry: Weill-Marchesani syndrome 3   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care,"Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) treatment focuses on managing the specific symptoms and complications that arise, as there's no cure for the underlying genetic defect.  Treatment approaches vary depending on the individual's presentation and may involve specialists from various medical disciplines.

Here's a breakdown of potential treatment strategies based on common WMS manifestations:

* **Ocular Issues:**
    * **Glaucoma:**  This is a significant concern in WMS and requires careful monitoring and management. Treatments can include eye drops, oral medications, laser procedures (like trabeculoplasty or iridotomy), and surgical interventions (like trabeculectomy or tube shunt surgery) to lower intraocular pressure and prevent optic nerve damage.
    * **Lens Subluxation/Dislocation (Ectopia Lentis):**  If the lens dislocates significantly and impairs vision, surgical removal (lensectomy) may be necessary.  This can be followed by the implantation of an artificial lens or correction with glasses or contact lenses.  Careful pre-operative evaluation is crucial due to the potential for other ocular abnormalities in WMS.
    * **Myopia (Nearsightedness) and other refractive errors:**  These can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.
    * **Cataracts:**  If cataracts develop and impair vision, surgical removal with intraocular lens implantation is typically recommended.

* **Cardiovascular Issues:**
    * **Heart Valve Abnormalities (e.g., mitral valve prolapse):**  Regular monitoring by a cardiologist is essential.  Medications may be prescribed to manage symptoms or prevent complications. In some cases, surgical intervention may be needed to repair or replace affected valves.
    * **Short Stature and Skeletal Abnormalities:**  While the short stature itself isn't typically treated, associated skeletal issues like joint stiffness or pain may require physical therapy or other supportive measures.

* **Other Considerations:**
    * **Genetic Counseling:**  This is strongly recommended for individuals with WMS and their families to discuss inheritance patterns, recurrence risks, and available testing options.
    * **Regular Monitoring:**  Ongoing monitoring by ophthalmologists, cardiologists, and other specialists as needed is crucial for early detection and management of potential complications.

**Important Note:** The provided resources are general medical information sources and do not offer specific treatment guidelines for WMS. The GeneReview on Weill-Marchesani syndrome is the most specific resource listed and should be consulted for more detailed information.

What are the treatments for Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia ?,"How might Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia be treated? Treatment of Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD) is based on addressing individual symptoms as they develop.  Renal transplantation can treat the renal disease, and bone marrow transplantation has been done to treat the immunodeficiency.  Blood thinning medications can transiently improve blood flow through the atherosclerotic arteries but do not provide enduring relief from cerebral ischemia.  Treatment with acyclovir and some antibacterial agents has been beneficial for preventing of reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections.  More detailed information about treatment for SIOD can be found on the GeneReview's Web site. Click on the GeneReview link to read more.","Treatment for Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) focuses on managing the specific symptoms as they arise, given the lack of a cure for this multi-systemic disorder.  The following are the main treatment approaches:

* **Renal Disease:**  Progressive renal failure is a hallmark of SIOD.  **Renal transplantation** is the primary treatment for end-stage renal disease in these patients.

* **Immunodeficiency:** The immune deficiency associated with SIOD, characterized by T-cell dysfunction and lymphopenia, increases susceptibility to infections.  **Bone marrow transplantation** has been explored as a potential treatment to address the immunodeficiency. However, it's important to note that this procedure carries significant risks and its efficacy in SIOD is not fully established.

* **Cerebrovascular Disease:**  Stroke-like episodes caused by cerebrovascular disease are a significant concern. While blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants and antiplatelets) might offer temporary improvement in blood flow through affected arteries, they don't provide long-term protection against cerebral ischemia.  Managing hypertension and other vascular risk factors is crucial.

* **Infections:**  Prophylactic treatment with antiviral medications like **acyclovir** and certain antibacterial agents can help prevent or reduce the frequency of opportunistic infections, to which SIOD patients are particularly vulnerable.

* **Supportive Care:**  Management of other symptoms, such as growth retardation and other complications, is crucial. This often involves a multidisciplinary approach with specialists in nephrology, immunology, hematology, neurology, and other relevant fields.  Regular monitoring and appropriate interventions are essential for optimizing quality of life.

What are the symptoms of Coronary Microvascular Disease ?,"The signs and symptoms of coronary microvascular disease (MVD) often differ from the signs and symptoms of traditional coronary heart disease (CHD).
                
Many women with coronary MVD have angina (an-JI-nuh or AN-juh-nuh). Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood.
                
Angina may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. You also may feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. Angina pain may even feel like indigestion.
                
Angina also is a common symptom of CHD. However, the angina that occurs in coronary MVD may differ from the typical angina that occurs in CHD. In coronary MVD, the chest pain usually lasts longer than 10 minutes, and it can last longer than 30 minutes. Typical angina is more common in women older than 65.
                
Other signs and symptoms of coronary MVD are shortness of breath, sleep problems, fatigue (tiredness), and lack of energy.
                
Coronary MVD symptoms often are first noticed during routine daily activities (such as shopping, cooking, cleaning, and going to work) and times of mental stress. It's less likely that women will notice these symptoms during physical activity (such as jogging or walking fast).
                
This differs from CHD, in which symptoms often first appear while a person is being physically activesuch as while jogging, walking on a treadmill, or going up stairs.","Coronary microvascular disease (MVD) presents with symptoms distinct from typical coronary heart disease (CHD), particularly in women.  Key symptoms include:

* **Angina:** Chest pain or discomfort, often described as pressure or squeezing.  It can radiate to the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back, and may mimic indigestion.  A crucial difference from CHD-related angina is the *duration*: MVD angina typically lasts longer than 10 minutes, often exceeding 30 minutes.  While angina is common in both MVD and CHD, it's more prevalent in women over 65 with CHD.

* **Shortness of breath (Dyspnea):** Difficulty breathing or feeling breathless, even without exertion.

* **Sleep disturbances:** Difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or experiencing restful sleep.

* **Fatigue:** Persistent tiredness and lack of energy, impacting daily activities.

* **Reduced exercise capacity:** Difficulty with physical exertion, though symptoms are less likely to manifest *during* physical activity compared to CHD.  Instead, MVD symptoms often emerge during routine daily tasks or periods of mental stress.


It's important to note that these symptoms can be subtle and easily attributed to other conditions.  If you experience these symptoms, particularly persistent angina or unusual fatigue, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis.

Is VACTERL association inherited ?,"Most cases of VACTERL association are sporadic, which means they occur in people with no history of the condition in their family. Rarely, families have multiple people affected with VACTERL association. A few affected individuals have family members with one or two features, but not enough signs to be diagnosed with the condition. In these families, the features of VACTERL association often do not have a clear pattern of inheritance. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this condition and how severe the condition will be in an individual.","VACTERL association is generally **not considered inherited in the classic Mendelian pattern**.  While extremely rare familial cases have been reported, the vast majority of VACTERL occurrences are sporadic, meaning they arise without any prior family history.  Although a few families may have multiple affected members or individuals with some VACTERL features, the pattern of recurrence doesn't suggest a single, predictable inheritance mode.  Current understanding points to a complex interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors contributing to VACTERL association, rather than a single causative gene being passed down through families.",0.8273,0.4468,0.1183,0.2553,4.5527
What is (are) L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria ?,"L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is an inherited metabolic condition that is associated with progressive brain damage. Signs and symptoms of this condition typically begin during infancy or early childhood and may include developmental delay, seizures, speech difficulties, macrocephaly and abnormalities in a part of the brain called the cerebellum, which is involved in coordinating movement (i.e. balance and muscle coordination). L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by changes (mutations) in the L2HGDH gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is focused on alleviating the signs and symptoms of the condition, such as medications to control seizures.","L-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA) is a rare, inherited neurometabolic disorder characterized by the accumulation of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and other tissues. This buildup is due to a deficiency in the enzyme L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down L-2-hydroxyglutarate.  The resulting accumulation leads to progressive neurological damage.

Here's a breakdown of key features:

* **Clinical Presentation:**  Symptoms typically emerge in infancy or early childhood, though some individuals may not manifest symptoms until later in life. Common signs and symptoms include:
    * Developmental delay:  Delayed milestones in motor skills, language, and cognitive development.
    * Seizures:  Various seizure types can occur.
    * Speech difficulties:  Problems with articulation, comprehension, or both.
    * Macrocephaly:  Abnormally large head size.
    * Cerebellar abnormalities:  Affecting balance, coordination, and motor control.  Symptoms may include ataxia (lack of muscle coordination).
    * Other possible features:  Spasticity, extrapyramidal symptoms (movement disorders), and intellectual disability.

* **Genetics:** L-2-HGA is caused by mutations in the *L2HGDH* gene, which provides instructions for making the L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme.  It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that both parents must carry a mutated copy of the gene for a child to be affected.  If both parents are carriers, each child has a 25% chance of inheriting the disorder.

* **Diagnosis:**  Diagnosis is typically based on a combination of:
    * Clinical evaluation:  Assessing neurological symptoms and developmental milestones.
    * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):  Brain MRI often reveals characteristic abnormalities, particularly in the white matter and subcortical basal ganglia.
    * Biochemical testing:  Elevated levels of L-2-hydroxyglutaric acid can be detected in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid through specialized laboratory tests, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
    * Genetic testing:  Molecular genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis by identifying mutations in the *L2HGDH* gene.

* **Treatment:**  Currently, there is no cure for L-2-HGA.  Treatment is primarily supportive and focuses on managing symptoms:
    * Anticonvulsant medications:  To control seizures.
    * Physical therapy:  To improve motor skills and coordination.
    * Occupational therapy:  To address developmental delays and improve daily living skills.
    * Speech therapy:  To assist with communication difficulties.

* **Prognosis:**  The prognosis for individuals with L-2-HGA varies depending on the severity of symptoms.  The neurological damage is often progressive, leading to increasing disability over time.  Early diagnosis and intervention can help to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.


**Sources:**

While no specific source was provided in the context, information on L-2-HGA can be found in reputable medical databases such as OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) and GeneReviews.

What are the symptoms of Lissencephaly 1 ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Lissencephaly 1? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Lissencephaly 1. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Cerebellar hypoplasia - Heterotopia - Hypoplasia of the brainstem - Intellectual disability - Lissencephaly - Muscular hypotonia of the trunk - Pachygyria - Postnatal microcephaly - Seizures - Spastic tetraparesis - Sporadic - Variable expressivity - Ventriculomegaly - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Lissencephaly 1 is characterized by a range of neurological symptoms, primarily due to the abnormal development of the brain. The provided list from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) highlights some key features, though specific frequencies are lacking.  Here's a breakdown of the symptoms:

* **Lissencephaly:** This is the core feature of the condition, referring to the smooth brain surface due to a lack of normal folds (gyri) and grooves (sulci).

* **Pachygyria:**  Related to lissencephaly, this term describes abnormally thick gyri, further contributing to the smooth brain appearance.

* **Cerebellar hypoplasia:** Underdevelopment of the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible for coordination and balance. This can lead to difficulties with motor skills.

* **Hypoplasia of the brainstem:** Underdevelopment of the brainstem, which controls essential functions like breathing, heart rate, and consciousness.  This can lead to a variety of serious problems.

* **Ventriculomegaly:** Enlargement of the brain's ventricles (fluid-filled spaces).

* **Postnatal microcephaly:**  A smaller than normal head circumference developing after birth.  This reflects the underlying brain malformation.

* **Intellectual disability:**  Cognitive impairment ranging from mild to severe, affecting learning, problem-solving, and adaptive skills.

* **Seizures:**  Abnormal electrical activity in the brain, resulting in various types of seizures. This is a common symptom in lissencephaly.

* **Muscular hypotonia of the trunk:**  Low muscle tone, particularly in the torso, leading to weakness and difficulty with posture and movement.

* **Spastic tetraparesis:**  A form of cerebral palsy affecting all four limbs, characterized by increased muscle tone (spasticity), stiffness, and impaired movement.

* **Heterotopia:**  The presence of gray matter (normally found on the brain's surface) in abnormal locations within the brain. This is a result of disrupted neuronal migration during development.

The terms ""sporadic"" and ""variable expressivity"" describe the inheritance and presentation of the condition, not symptoms themselves:

* **Sporadic:**  Indicates that the condition isn't typically inherited but arises from a new genetic mutation in the affected individual.

* **Variable expressivity:**  Means that the severity and combination of symptoms can vary widely, even among individuals with the same genetic mutation.

It's crucial to remember that this list isn't exhaustive, and the presence and severity of symptoms can vary significantly.  For a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis, consultation with a medical specialist, ideally a neurologist or geneticist experienced with lissencephaly, is essential.  Genetic testing is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",0.8091,0.3778,0.0764,0.1778,13.1019
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Multiple Sclerosis ?,"The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and other institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct research in laboratories at the NIH and also support additional research through grants to major medical institutions across the country. Scientists continue their extensive efforts to create new and better therapies for MS. One of the most promising MS research areas involves naturally occurring antiviral proteins known as interferons. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations and may slow the progression of physical disability. When attacks do occur, they tend to be shorter and less severe. In addition, there are a number of treatments under investigation that may curtail attacks or improve function. Over a dozen clinical trials testing potential therapies are underway, and additional new treatments are being devised and tested in animal models.
                
In 2001, the National Academies/Institute of Medicine, a Federal technical and scientific advisory agency, prepared a strategic review of MS research. To read or download the National Academies/Institute of Medicine report, go to: ""Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.""","Research into Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is active and ongoing, focusing on several key areas:

**1. Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs):**  Research continues to refine existing DMTs like interferons and develop new ones.  These aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow disease progression, and limit the accumulation of disability.  Clinical trials are constantly evaluating new agents targeting different aspects of the immune system and neuroprotective strategies.

* **Examples of areas of investigation within DMTs:**
    * **B-cell targeting therapies:**  Several approved DMTs now target B cells, a type of immune cell implicated in MS. Research continues to explore the optimal use of these therapies and develop new ones.
    * **T-cell targeting therapies:**  Research is ongoing into therapies that modulate T-cell activity, another type of immune cell involved in MS.
    * **Neuroprotective therapies:** These aim to protect nerve cells from damage and promote repair.  This is a challenging area, but holds significant promise for preventing long-term disability.

**2. Repair and Regeneration:**  This research focuses on promoting the repair of damaged myelin (the protective sheath around nerve fibers) and nerve cells in the central nervous system.  Strategies include:

* **Myelin repair therapies:**  Researchers are investigating drugs and other interventions that stimulate remyelination.
* **Stem cell therapies:**  Clinical trials are exploring the potential of stem cells to repair damaged tissues in the brain and spinal cord.

**3. Symptomatic Treatment:**  Research is ongoing to improve the management of MS symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, spasticity, and cognitive dysfunction.  This includes:

* **Pharmacological interventions:**  Developing and testing new drugs to address specific symptoms.
* **Non-pharmacological interventions:**  Exploring the effectiveness of approaches like physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and cognitive rehabilitation.

**4. Understanding the Cause and Mechanisms of MS:**  Basic research is crucial for identifying the underlying causes of MS and the mechanisms that drive disease progression. This includes:

* **Genetic studies:**  Investigating the genetic factors that contribute to MS susceptibility.
* **Environmental factors:**  Exploring the role of environmental factors, such as infections and vitamin D deficiency, in triggering or exacerbating MS.
* **Immunological studies:**  Further characterizing the immune system's role in MS.

**5. Biomarkers and Imaging:**  Researchers are working to identify biomarkers that can predict disease course, monitor treatment response, and improve early diagnosis.  Advanced imaging techniques are also being developed to better visualize and quantify disease activity.


**Finding Clinical Trials:**

To find current clinical trials for MS, you can search online databases such as:

"Is 48,XXYY syndrome inherited ?","This condition is not inherited; it usually occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm). An error in cell division called nondisjunction results in a reproductive cell with an abnormal number of chromosomes. In 48,XXYY syndrome, the extra sex chromosomes almost always come from a sperm cell. Nondisjunction may cause a sperm cell to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a sperm cell with three sex chromosomes (one X and two Y chromosomes). If that sperm cell fertilizes a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, the resulting child will have two X chromosomes and two Y chromosomes in each of the body's cells.  In a small percentage of cases, 48,XXYY syndrome results from nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes in a 46,XY embryo very soon after fertilization has occurred. This means that an normal sperm cell with one Y chromosome fertilized a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, but right after fertilization nondisjunction of the sex chromosomes caused the embryo to gain two extra sex chromosomes, resulting in a 48,XXYY embryo.","48,XXYY syndrome is not inherited in the traditional sense of being passed down from parent to child through genes.  It is almost always caused by a random error in cell division called nondisjunction that occurs during the formation of sperm cells. This error leads to a sperm cell having an extra X and Y chromosome. When this abnormal sperm fertilizes a normal egg, the resulting embryo has 48,XXYY syndrome.  In rare cases, the nondisjunction event can occur after fertilization in a 46,XY embryo, leading to 48,XXYY syndrome.  Neither of these scenarios involves the inheritance of a disease-causing gene from a parent.",0.8486,0.531,0.2153,0.2759,4.9393
What is (are) Sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive ?,"Sideroblastic anemia pyridoxine-refractory autosomal recessive is an inherited blood disorder that is characterized by an impaired ability of the bone marrow to produce normal red blood cells. The iron inside red blood cells is inadequately used to make hemoglobin, despite adequate or increased amounts of iron. Abnormal red blood cells called sideroblasts are found in the blood of people with this anemia. It is caused by mutations in the SLC25A38 gene. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Unlike other forms of sideroblastic anemia, this form is not responsive to vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).","Sideroblastic anemia, pyridoxine-refractory, autosomal recessive (ARSA) is a rare, inherited form of sideroblastic anemia characterized by the bone marrow's inability to effectively utilize iron for heme synthesis, the critical component of hemoglobin responsible for oxygen transport.  This leads to anemia, a deficiency of red blood cells, and the accumulation of iron within developing red blood cells in the bone marrow. These iron-laden cells are called ring sideroblasts due to the ring-like appearance of iron granules around the nucleus when stained and viewed under a microscope.

Key features distinguishing ARSA from other sideroblastic anemias include:

* **Pyridoxine-refractory:**  Unlike some other forms of sideroblastic anemia, ARSA does not respond to treatment with pyridoxine (vitamin B6), a cofactor crucial for heme synthesis. This unresponsiveness is a key diagnostic indicator.
* **Autosomal recessive inheritance:** ARSA is caused by mutations in the *SLC25A38* gene. This gene encodes a mitochondrial protein crucial for transporting glycine, a key amino acid, into the mitochondria where heme synthesis takes place.  Because it is autosomal recessive, two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are required to develop the condition.  Individuals with only one mutated copy are carriers but typically do not exhibit symptoms.
* **Variable clinical presentation:** The severity of ARSA can vary widely, even within the same family. Some individuals may experience mild anemia, while others may require regular blood transfusions.  Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pallor.  Iron overload is a common complication due to the ineffective utilization of iron and can lead to damage in organs like the liver and heart if not managed.

**Diagnosis:**  Diagnosis of ARSA involves a combination of:

* **Complete blood count (CBC):**  Reveals anemia with characteristic features like hypochromic (pale) and microcytic (small) red blood cells.
* **Peripheral blood smear:**  Microscopic examination of blood reveals the presence of ring sideroblasts.
* **Bone marrow examination:**  Confirms the presence of ring sideroblasts and assesses iron stores.
* **Genetic testing:**  Identifies mutations in the *SLC25A38* gene, confirming the diagnosis.

**Treatment:**  Management of ARSA focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications from iron overload.

* **Blood transfusions:**  May be necessary for individuals with severe anemia.
* **Iron chelation therapy:**  Helps remove excess iron from the body, preventing organ damage.
* **Supportive care:**  May include nutritional counseling and management of other associated symptoms.

**(Source information:  While specific citations are difficult for a general overview, this information is based on established medical knowledge of sideroblastic anemias and the role of the *SLC25A38* gene.

What is (are) antiphospholipid syndrome ?,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder caused when antibodies -- immune system cells that fight off bacteria and viruses -- mistakenly attack healthy body tissues and organs. In APS, specific antibodies activate the inner lining of blood vessels, which leads to the formation of blood clots in arteries or veins. APS is sometimes called sticky blood syndrome, because of the increased tendency to form blood clots in the veins and arteries. The symptoms of APS are due to the abnormal blood clotting. Clots can develop in the veins of the legs and lungs, or in the placenta of pregnant women. One of the most serious complications of APS occurs when a clot forms in the brain and causes a stroke. Other neurological symptoms include chronic headaches, dementia (similar to the dementia of Alzheimers disease), and seizures. Infrequently, individuals will develop chorea (a movement disorder in which the body and limbs writhe uncontrollably), cognitive dysfunction (such as poor memory), transverse myelitis, depression or psychosis, optic neuropathy, or sudden hearing loss. In pregnant women, clots in the placenta can cause miscarriages. APS is diagnosed by the presence of a positive antiphospholipid antibody and either a history of blood clots in an artery or vein or a history of multiple miscarriages or other pregnancy problems. Some individuals will have a characteristic lacy, net-like red rash called livedo reticularis over their wrists and knees.","Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also known as sticky blood syndrome, is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies that target phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. These antibodies erroneously attack healthy tissues, particularly the inner lining of blood vessels, leading to an increased risk of blood clot formation (thrombosis) in both arteries and veins.

While the provided context gives a good overview, here's a more structured explanation:

**Pathophysiology:**

APS is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), including lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. These antibodies disrupt the normal coagulation cascade, promoting blood clot formation. The exact mechanism is complex and not fully understood, but it involves interactions with platelets, endothelial cells, and coagulation factors.

**Clinical Manifestations:**

The symptoms of APS are highly variable and depend on the location of the blood clots.  They can include:

* **Venous thrombosis:** Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs, pulmonary embolism (PE) in the lungs.
* **Arterial thrombosis:** Stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), heart attack, and peripheral artery disease.
* **Pregnancy complications:** Recurrent miscarriage, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth.
* **Other manifestations:** Livedo reticularis (a mottled, net-like skin rash), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), heart valve abnormalities, and neurological symptoms like headaches, seizures, and cognitive dysfunction.

**Diagnosis:**

APS is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical findings and laboratory tests.  This typically involves:

1. **Clinical criteria:**  A history of vascular thrombosis or pregnancy complications as described above.
2. **Laboratory criteria:**  Persistently positive tests for aPL antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and/or anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies) on at least two occasions, 12 weeks apart.

**Treatment:**

The primary goal of APS treatment is to prevent blood clot formation and manage existing clots.  Treatment strategies include:

* **Anticoagulants:**  Medications like warfarin (Coumadin) or newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are used to thin the blood and prevent clotting.
* **Antiplatelet agents:**  Low-dose aspirin may be used in some cases, particularly for those with a history of arterial thrombosis.
* **Immunosuppressants:** In severe cases or those with refractory disease, immunosuppressants may be considered to reduce antibody production.

What are the symptoms of Esthesioneuroblastoma ?,What symptoms are associated with esthesioneuroblastoma? Symptoms of esthesioneuroblastoma may include one or more of the following: Nasal obstruction Loss of smell Chronic sinus infections (sinusitis) Nasal bleeding Sinus pain and headache  Visual changes,"Esthesioneuroblastoma, also known as olfactory neuroblastoma, is a rare cancer originating in the olfactory epithelium located high in the nasal cavity.  Symptoms can vary depending on tumor size and extent of spread.  While the context you provided lists some common symptoms, a more comprehensive list includes:

**Local Symptoms (related to the nasal cavity and surrounding structures):**

* **Nasal obstruction:** This is often one of the earliest and most common symptoms, sometimes affecting only one nostril.
* **Epistaxis (nosebleeds):**  Can range from minor to severe.
* **Hyposmia or anosmia (loss of smell):**  Due to the tumor's origin in the olfactory epithelium.
* **Rhinorrhea (runny nose):**  May be clear, purulent, or even bloody.
* **Sinusitis (sinus infections):**  Chronic or recurrent infections.
* **Facial pain or pressure:**  Especially around the nose, sinuses, and eyes.
* **Headache:** Can be localized or generalized.
* **Nasal mass:**  May be visible or palpable in later stages.

**Symptoms related to spread or invasion:**

* **Diplopia (double vision):**  If the tumor invades the orbit (eye socket).
* **Proptosis (bulging eyes):**  Also due to orbital invasion.
* **Epiphora (excessive tearing):**  Related to blockage of tear ducts.
* **Visual changes:** Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, or visual field defects.
* **Hearing loss or ear fullness:**  If the tumor extends to the middle ear.
* **Neck mass (cervical lymphadenopathy):**  Indicates spread to lymph nodes.
* **Cranial nerve palsies:**  Depending on which nerves are affected, can cause a variety of symptoms, including facial numbness or weakness, difficulty swallowing, and changes in voice.


It's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other, less serious conditions.  Therefore, it's crucial to consult a medical professional for a proper diagnosis if you experience any of these symptoms, especially persistent nasal obstruction, nosebleeds, or loss of smell.  Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the best possible outcome with esthesioneuroblastoma.


While I can't provide specific medical sources in this format, information on esthesioneuroblastoma can be found on reputable websites like the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS).

What is (are) Cystocele ?,"A cystocele, also called a prolapsed or dropped bladder, is the bulging or dropping of the bladder into the vagina. The bladder, located in the pelvis between the pelvic bones, is a hollow, muscular, balloon-shaped organ that expands as it fills with urine. During urination, also called voiding, the bladder empties through the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. The urethra is the tube that carries urine outside of the body. The vagina is the tube in a womans body that runs beside the urethra and connects the womb, or uterus, to the outside of the body.","A cystocele, also known as a prolapsed or dropped bladder, occurs when the bladder bulges or descends into the vagina.  This happens due to a weakening or stretching of the pelvic floor muscles and tissues that normally support the bladder and other pelvic organs, allowing the bladder to displace from its usual position.  

The provided context accurately describes the anatomical relationships relevant to a cystocele:

* **Bladder:** A hollow, muscular organ that stores urine.
* **Urethra:** The tube through which urine exits the body.
* **Vagina:** The canal connecting the uterus to the external genitalia.
* **Pelvic Floor:**  A group of muscles and connective tissues that support the pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus, and rectum.

While the context is accurate, it's important to add that cystoceles can range in severity from mild (a slight bulge) to severe (where the bladder protrudes through the vaginal opening).  Symptoms can vary as well, from being asymptomatic to including urinary incontinence, difficulty emptying the bladder completely, a feeling of pressure or fullness in the vagina, and discomfort during sexual intercourse.

Risk factors for cystocele development include:

* **Childbirth:** Vaginal delivery, especially multiple deliveries or deliveries involving large babies, can weaken the pelvic floor.
* **Aging:**  As women age, estrogen levels decrease, which can contribute to pelvic floor weakening.
* **Obesity:**  Excess weight puts added strain on the pelvic floor.
* **Chronic constipation and straining:**  Repeated straining during bowel movements can weaken the pelvic floor.
* **Heavy lifting:**  Regularly lifting heavy objects can also contribute to pelvic floor weakness.

Treatment options depend on the severity of the cystocele and can range from conservative measures like pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) and pessaries (devices inserted into the vagina to support the bladder) to surgical repair.",0.6048,0.3412,0.1372,0.231,9.3232

Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication, and the symptoms described are *not* caused by Warfarin itself, but rather by **fetal warfarin syndrome (FWS)**, a rare condition that occurs when a pregnant woman takes warfarin during the first trimester.  It's crucial to distinguish between the therapeutic use of warfarin and the teratogenic effects of its use during pregnancy.

Therefore, the symptoms listed describe the potential effects of *in-utero* exposure to warfarin, *not* a syndrome caused by taking warfarin after birth.

Here's a breakdown of the symptoms of Fetal Warfarin Syndrome (FWS), categorized by frequency based on the provided data:

**Frequently Observed (90%):**

* **Abnormal vertebral ossification:** Incomplete or irregular bone formation in the spine.
* **Anteverted nares:** Upward-turned nostrils.
* **Depressed nasal bridge:** A flattened or low nasal bridge.
* **Epiphyseal stippling:** Calcification or spotting within the growth plates of bones.
* **Short nose:** A shorter than average nose.

**Moderately Observed (50%):**

* **Anonychia:** Absence of fingernails or toenails.
* **Brachydactyly syndrome:** Shortened fingers and/or toes.
* **Cognitive impairment:** Intellectual disability or developmental delays.
* **Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR):** Slowed fetal growth during pregnancy.
* **Respiratory insufficiency:** Difficulty breathing.
* **Short distal phalanx of finger:** Shortened bones in the fingertips.
* **Short neck:** A shorter than average neck.


**Less Frequently Observed (7.5%):**

* **Abnormality of the outer ear:** Malformations of the external ear structure.
* **Abnormality of the tongue:**  Issues with tongue size, shape, or function.
* **Aplasia/Hypoplasia affecting the eye:** Underdevelopment or absence of eye tissues.
* **Cataract:** Clouding of the eye lens.
* **Choanal atresia:** Blockage of the nasal passages.
* **Hearing impairment:** Reduced ability to hear.
* **Hydrocephalus:** Buildup of fluid in the brain.
* **Hypertelorism:** Abnormally wide-spaced eyes.
* **Muscular hypotonia:** Low muscle tone.
* **Myelomeningocele (Spina Bifida):** A birth defect where the spinal cord doesn't close completely.
* **Optic atrophy:** Damage to the optic nerve.
* **Proptosis:** Bulging eyes.
* **Seizures:** Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
* **Visual impairment:** Reduced ability to see.


It's important to note that the frequency percentages given are estimates and can vary.  Not all infants exposed to warfarin in utero will develop FWS, and the severity of symptoms can range widely.

If a pregnant woman requires anticoagulation, alternative medications like low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are generally preferred to minimize the risk of FWS.  Any woman taking warfarin who suspects she might be pregnant should consult her doctor immediately.

What are the symptoms of Typhoid Fever ?,"Persons with typhoid fever usually have a sustained fever as high as 103ÃÂ° to 104ÃÂ° F (39ÃÂ° to 40ÃÂ° C). They may also feel weak, or have stomach pains, headache, or loss of appetite. In some cases, patients have a rash of flat, rose-colored spots. The only way to know for sure if an illness is typhoid fever is to have samples of stool or blood tested for the presence of Salmonella Typhi.

Typhoid feverÃ¢â¬â¢s danger doesnÃ¢â¬â¢t end when symptoms disappear: 

Even if your symptoms seem to go away, you may still be carrying Salmonella Typhi. If so, the illness could return, or you could pass the disease to other people. In fact, if you work at a job where you handle food or care for small children, you may be barred legally from going back to work until a doctor has determined that you no longer carry any typhoid bacteria.
                
If you are being treated for typhoid fever, it is important to do the following:
                
Keep taking the prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has asked you to take them.
                
Wash your hands carefully with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance that you will pass the infection on to someone else.
                
Have your doctor perform a series of stool cultures to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in your body.","The symptoms of typhoid fever, as described in the provided text, include:

* **Sustained high fever:**  103° to 104° F (39° to 40° C)
* **Weakness**
* **Stomach pains**
* **Headache**
* **Loss of appetite**
* **Rash:** In some cases, a rash of flat, rose-colored spots may appear.

It's crucial to note that these are just potential symptoms, and the only definitive way to diagnose typhoid fever is through laboratory testing of stool or blood samples for the presence of *Salmonella* Typhi bacteria.",0.8438,0.3851,0.2125,0.2857,4.4675
What are the genetic changes related to Marfan syndrome ?,"Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome. The FBN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 attaches (binds) to other fibrillin-1 proteins and other molecules to form threadlike filaments called microfibrils. Microfibrils become part of the fibers that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue. Additionally, microfibrils store molecules called growth factors and release them at various times to control the growth and repair of tissues and organs throughout the body. A mutation in the FBN1 gene can reduce the amount of functional fibrillin-1 that is available to form microfibrils, which leads to decreased microfibril formation. As a result, excess growth factors are released and elasticity in many tissues is decreased, leading to overgrowth and instability of tissues.","Marfan syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the *FBN1* gene located on chromosome 15.  This gene encodes for the protein fibrillin-1, a crucial component of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix.  

The genetic changes related to Marfan syndrome are predominantly **heterozygous mutations** in the *FBN1* gene.  These mutations can take several forms, including:

* **Missense mutations:** These mutations result in a change in a single amino acid in the fibrillin-1 protein.  This can affect the protein's structure and function, impacting microfibril formation.

* **Nonsense mutations:** These mutations introduce a premature stop codon in the *FBN1* gene, leading to a truncated, non-functional fibrillin-1 protein.

* **Splice site mutations:** These mutations affect the way the *FBN1* gene is processed, potentially leading to the inclusion or exclusion of certain exons in the final mRNA transcript. This can alter the structure and function of the resulting fibrillin-1 protein.

* **Deletions and insertions:** Small or large deletions and insertions of DNA within the *FBN1* gene can also disrupt the production or function of fibrillin-1.

While the vast majority of Marfan syndrome cases are linked to *FBN1* mutations, a small percentage are associated with mutations in the *TGFBR1* and *TGFBR2* genes, which are involved in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway.  This pathway is influenced by fibrillin-1, and disruptions in either the *TGFBR1* or *TGFBR2* genes can produce a Marfan-like syndrome.

It's important to note that the specific type and location of the *FBN1* mutation can influence the severity and presentation of Marfan syndrome.  There is no single mutation that causes all cases of the condition.  Genetic testing is crucial for confirming a diagnosis.",0.746,0.3134,0.095,0.199,8.9927
What causes Geographic tongue ?,"What causes geographic tongue? Is it genetic? The exact cause of geographic tongue has not been identified. However, because the condition may be present in several members of the same family, genetics may increase a person's chances of developing the condition. A study by Guimares (2007) showed that a specific variant of a gene called IL-1B (interleukin-1 beta) is associated with an increased risk of developing geographic tongue and suggests a genetic basis for the development of the disease. Further research may result in a better understanding of the genetic influences involved in the development of geographic tongue.","The exact cause of geographic tongue remains unknown. However, current research suggests a strong genetic component. While no single gene is definitively responsible, studies like the one by Guimarães et al. (2007) have identified associations between specific gene variants, such as IL-1B (interleukin-1 beta), and an increased risk of developing the condition.  This suggests that individuals with certain genetic predispositions may be more susceptible.  Familial clustering further supports the role of genetics, as multiple members within the same family can present with geographic tongue.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the genetic mechanisms involved and identify other potential contributing factors.",0.7976,0.4976,0.2167,0.322,4.278

Biology and High Blood Pressure
                
Researchers continue to study how various changes in normal body functions cause high blood pressure. The key functions affected in high blood pressure include:
                
Kidney fluid and salt balances
                
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
                
Sympathetic nervous system activity
                
Blood vessel structure and function
                

                
Kidney Fluid and Salt Balances
                
The kidneys normally regulate the bodys salt balance by retaining sodium and water and excreting potassium. Imbalances in this kidney function can expand blood volumes, which can cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
                
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system makes angiotensin and aldosterone hormones. Angiotensin narrows or constricts blood vessels, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone controls how the kidneys balance fluid and salt levels. Increased aldosterone levels or activity may change this kidney function, leading to increased blood volumes and high blood pressure.
                

                
Sympathetic Nervous System Activity
                
The sympathetic nervous system has important functions in blood pressure regulation, including heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate. Researchers are investigating whether imbalances in this system cause high blood pressure.
                

                
Blood Vessel Structure and Function
                
Changes in the structure and function of small and large arteries may contribute to high blood pressure. The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may stiffen small and large arteries, which can affect blood pressure.
                

                
Genetic Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Much of the understanding of the body systems involved in high blood pressure has come from genetic studies. High blood pressure often runs in families. Years of research have identified many genes and other mutations associated with high blood pressure, some in the renal salt regulatory and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathways. However, these known genetic factors only account for 2 to 3percent of all cases. Emerging research suggests that certain DNA changes during fetal development also may cause the development of high blood pressure later in life.
                
Environmental Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Environmental causes of high blood pressure include unhealthy lifestyle habits, being overweight or obese, and medicines.
                

                
Unhealthy Lifestyle Habits
                
Unhealthy lifestyle habits can cause high blood pressure, including:
                
High dietary sodium intake and sodium sensitivity
                
Drinking excess amounts of alcohol
                
Lack of physical activity
                

                
Overweight and Obesity
                
Research studies show that being overweight or obese can increase the resistance in the blood vessels, causing the heart to work harder and leading to high blood pressure.
                

                
Medicines
                
Prescription medicines such as asthma or hormone therapies, including birth control pills and estrogen, and over-the-counter medicines such as cold relief medicines may cause this form of high blood pressure. This happens because medicines can change the way your body controls fluid and salt balances, cause your blood vessels to constrict, or impact the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to high blood pressure.
                
Other Medical Causes of High Blood Pressure
                
Other medical causes of high blood pressure include other medical conditions such as chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea, thyroid problems, or certain tumors. This happens because these other conditions change the way your body controls fluids, sodium, and hormones in your blood, which leads to secondary high blood pressure.","The causes of high blood pressure (hypertension) are complex and can be broadly categorized as genetic, environmental, and secondary to other medical conditions.

**1. Genetic Factors:**

* **Family History:**  Hypertension tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic component.
* **Specific Genes:** While research has identified genes associated with blood pressure regulation (e.g., those involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and renal salt regulation), these only account for a small percentage of cases (2-3%).
* **Epigenetic Changes:** Emerging research suggests that changes to DNA during fetal development may influence the later development of hypertension.

**2. Environmental Factors:**

* **Unhealthy Lifestyle:**
    * **High Sodium Diet:** Excess sodium intake can lead to fluid retention, increasing blood volume and pressure.  Sodium sensitivity, where individuals are particularly susceptible to the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium, also plays a role.
    * **Excessive Alcohol Consumption:**  Regular heavy drinking can raise blood pressure.
    * **Lack of Physical Activity:**  Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy cardiovascular system and can lower blood pressure.
* **Overweight and Obesity:** Increased body mass increases vascular resistance, forcing the heart to work harder and contributing to elevated blood pressure.

**3. Secondary Hypertension (due to other medical conditions):**

* **Chronic Kidney Disease:**  Kidney dysfunction disrupts fluid and electrolyte balance, contributing to hypertension.
* **Sleep Apnea:** This sleep disorder is associated with intermittent oxygen deprivation, which can raise blood pressure.
* **Thyroid Problems:** Both hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can affect blood pressure.
* **Certain Tumors:**  Rare tumors that affect hormone production (e.g., pheochromocytoma) can cause hypertension.
* **Medications:** Some medications, including certain asthma medications, hormone therapies (birth control pills, estrogen), decongestants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can contribute to or exacerbate hypertension.  This is often due to effects on fluid balance, vasoconstriction, or the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.


**Physiological Mechanisms Involved in Hypertension:**

The provided text highlights several key physiological systems involved in blood pressure regulation that can be disrupted in hypertension:

* **Kidney Fluid and Salt Balance:** The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating sodium and water balance.  Dysfunction can lead to increased blood volume and pressure.
* **Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS):** This hormonal system regulates blood pressure through vasoconstriction (angiotensin) and sodium retention (aldosterone). Overactivity of the RAAS can contribute to hypertension.
* **Sympathetic Nervous System:** This system influences heart rate, blood vessel constriction, and other factors affecting blood pressure.  Imbalances in sympathetic nervous system activity are implicated in hypertension.
* **Blood Vessel Structure and Function:** Changes in the structure and function of arteries (e.g., stiffening) can increase vascular resistance and contribute to elevated blood pressure.  The angiotensin pathway and the immune system may play a role in these vascular changes.


It's important to note that hypertension often has multiple contributing factors, and the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental influences is complex.  Consulting with a healthcare professional is essential for accurate diagnosis and management of hypertension.",0.7545,0.5206,0.2382,0.1984,18.4664
What are the possible treatments for asthma?,"Asthma is a long-term disease that has no cure. The goal of asthma treatment is to control the disease. Good asthma control will:
                
Prevent chronic and troublesome symptoms, such as coughing and shortness of breath
                
Reduce your need for quick-relief medicines (see below)
                
Help you maintain good lung function
                
Let you maintain your normal activity level and sleep through the night
                
Prevent asthma attacks that could result in an emergency room visit or hospital stay
                
To control asthma, partner with your doctor to manage your asthma or your child's asthma. Children aged 10 or olderand younger children who are ableshould take an active role in their asthma care.
                
Taking an active role to control your asthma involves:
                
Working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management.
                
Avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers). However, one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.
                
Working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan.
                
An asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly, avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity), tracking your level of asthma control, responding to worsening symptoms, and seeking emergency care when needed.
                
Asthma is treated with two types of medicines: long-term control and quick-relief medicines. Long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Quick-relief, or ""rescue,"" medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up.
                
Your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma. Followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks.
                
Your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home, school, or work environments. These changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma.
                
Your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control. On the other hand, if your asthma is well controlled for several months, your doctor may decrease your medicine. These adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary.
                
Asthma treatment for certain groups of peoplesuch as children, pregnant women, or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptomswill be adjusted to meet their special needs.
                
Follow an Asthma Action Plan
                
You can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan. The plan will describe your daily treatments, such as which medicines to take and when to take them. The plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room.
                
If your child has asthma, all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan. This includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers, schools, and camps. These caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan.
                
Go to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) ""Asthma Action Plan"" for a sample plan.
                
Avoid Things That Can Worsen Your Asthma
                
Many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Once you know what these things are, you can take steps to control many of them. (For more information about asthma triggers, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?"")
                
For example, exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse. If so, try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high. If animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms, keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom.
                
One possible asthma trigger you shouldnt avoid is physical activity. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active.
                
The NHLBI offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers. For more information, go to page 2 of NHLBI's ""Asthma Action Plan.""
                
If your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens, and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens, your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots.
                
You may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots. These shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms, but they can't cure your asthma.
                
Several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage. These conditions include runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea. Your doctor will treat these conditions as well.
                
Medicines
                
Your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you. He or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you. Then, he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed.
                
Asthma medicines can be taken in pill form, but most are taken using a device called an inhaler. An inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs.
                
Not all inhalers are used the same way. Ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit.
                
Long-Term Control Medicines
                
Most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms. The most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation, which helps prevent symptoms from starting. These medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma. They're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances.
                
Reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms. Most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed. These medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. Inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming, even if you take them every day for many years.
                
Like many other medicines, though, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. Most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects.
                
One common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush. You might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush. These devices attach to your inhaler. They help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat.
                
Check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have. Also, work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber. Rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush.
                
If you have severe asthma, you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control.
                
If taken for long periods, these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (OS-te-o-po-RO-sis). A cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break.
                
Your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids. Or, your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D pills to protect your bones.
                
Other long-term control medicines. Other long-term control medicines include:
                
Cromolyn. This medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer. As you breathe in, the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs. Cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation.
                
Omalizumab (anti-IgE). This medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month. It helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers, such as pollen and dust mites. Anti-IgE might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well.
                
A rare, but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the Omalizumab injection is given. If you take this medication, work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you should take.
                
Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists. These medicines open the airways. They might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control. Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control. They must used with inhaled corticosteroids.
                
Leukotriene modifiers. These medicines are taken by mouth. They help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways.
                
Theophylline. This medicine is taken by mouth. Theophylline helps open the airways.
                
If your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine, take it every day to control your asthma. Your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine.
                
Long-term control medicines can have side effects. Talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them.
                
With some medicines, like theophylline, your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood. This helps ensure that youre getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms, but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects.
                
Quick-Relief Medicines
                
All people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up. Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief.
                
These medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup. This allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them.
                
You should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms. If you use this medicine more than 2 days a week, talk with your doctor about your asthma control. You may need to make changes to your asthma action plan.
                
Carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it. If your child has asthma, make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines, including staff at the child's school. They should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child.
                
You shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines. Quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation.
                
Track Your Asthma
                
To track your asthma, keep records of your symptoms, check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter, and get regular asthma checkups.
                
Record Your Symptoms
                
You can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma.
                
Asthma is well controlled if:
                
You have symptoms no more than 2 days a week, and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month.
                
You can do all your normal activities.
                
You take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week.
                
You have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth.
                
Your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number.
                
If your asthma isn't well controlled, contact your doctor. He or she may need to change your asthma action plan.
                
Use a Peak Flow Meter
                
This small, hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs. You blow into the device and it gives you a score, or peak flow number. Your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test.
                
Your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter. He or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score.
                
Your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results. You may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you.
                
When you're first diagnosed with asthma, it's important to find your ""personal best"" peak flow number. To do this, you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled. The highest number you get during that time is your personal best. You can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled.
                
Your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. If your score shows that your breathing is getting worse, you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs. Then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked.
                
Get Asthma Checkups
                
When you first begin treatment, you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks. Once your asthma is controlled, your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year.
                
During these checkups, your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements. He or she also may ask about your daily activities. This information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control.
                
Your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan. Based on your answers to these questions, your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine.
                
If your control is very good, you might be able to take less medicine. The goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma.
                
Emergency Care
                
Most people who have asthma, including many children, can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans. However, you might need medical attention at times.
                
Call your doctor for advice if:
                
Your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack.
                
Your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number.
                
Call 911 for emergency care if:
                
You have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath.
                
You have blue lips or fingernails.
                
At the hospital, you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines, as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home. Such treatment can save your life.
                
Asthma Treatment for Special Groups
                
The treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma. However, some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs.
                
Children
                
It's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years. Thus, it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines. (Quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not.)
                
Doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if, after assessing a child, they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age. (For more information, go to ""How Is Asthma Diagnosed?"")
                
Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children. Montelukast and cromolyn are other options. Treatment might be given for a trial period of 1month to 6 weeks. Treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly.
                
Inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages. Slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment, is generally small, and doesn't get worse over time. Poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate.
                
Many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth.
                
Older Adults
                
Doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines, such as beta blockers, aspirin and other pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines. These medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms.
                
Be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.
                
Older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids, especially at high doses. Talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin D pills, as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong.
                
Pregnant Women
                
Pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies. Poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia, a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight.
                
Studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack.
                
Talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant. Your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed.
                
People Whose Asthma Symptoms Occur With Physical Activity
                
Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Adults need physical activity to maintain good health. Children need it for growth and development.
                
In some people, however, physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms. If this happens to you or your child, talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active.
                
The following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity:
                
Short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them.
                
Long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours. However, with daily use, they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection. Also, frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled.
                
Leukotriene modifiers. These pills are taken several hours before physical activity. They can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity.
                
Long-term control medicines. Frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation. This will help prevent exercise-related symptoms.
                
Easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful. You also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather.
                
If you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs, you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose.
                
People Having Surgery
                
Asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack.
                
Tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her. The surgeon can take steps to lower your risk, such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery.","Asthma treatment focuses on controlling the disease and preventing symptoms.  There is no cure.  Treatment approaches involve medication, lifestyle adjustments, and creating a personalized asthma action plan.

**Medications:**

Asthma medications fall into two main categories:

* **Long-term control medications:** These are taken daily to prevent symptoms by reducing airway inflammation.  They are the cornerstone of asthma management for most patients.  Examples include:
    * **Inhaled corticosteroids:** The most effective long-term control medication.  They reduce inflammation and swelling in the airways.  Potential side effects include oral thrush (a fungal infection), which can be mitigated by using a spacer with the inhaler and rinsing the mouth after use.
    * **Cromolyn:**  Helps prevent airway inflammation, administered via a nebulizer.
    * **Omalizumab (anti-IgE):** Injectable medication given one or two times a month.  Blocks the body's reaction to asthma triggers. Carries a risk of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction).
    * **Inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs):**  Relax and open the airways.  Must be used *in combination* with inhaled corticosteroids, never alone for long-term control.
    * **Leukotriene modifiers:** Oral medication that blocks the inflammatory response in the airways.
    * **Theophylline:** Oral medication that helps open the airways. Blood levels need to be monitored to avoid side effects.

* **Quick-relief medications (rescue inhalers):** Used to quickly relieve asthma symptoms during a flare-up or asthma attack.  
    * **Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists:**  The primary quick-relief medication.  Relaxes the muscles around the airways, allowing them to open.  Overuse (more than 2 days a week) may indicate poorly controlled asthma.

**Non-Medication Strategies:**

* **Asthma Action Plan:** A personalized plan developed with your doctor outlining daily medication routines, how to avoid triggers, track symptoms, and respond to worsening asthma.  This plan should be shared with all caregivers.
* **Identifying and Avoiding Triggers:**  Common triggers include allergens (pollen, dust mites, pet dander), air pollution, respiratory infections, exercise, and stress.  While triggers should be avoided, patients should *not* avoid physical activity.  Work with your doctor to manage asthma symptoms related to exercise.
* **Allergy Shots (Immunotherapy):**  If allergens are significant triggers, allergy shots may be considered to reduce sensitivity.
* **Managing Coexisting Conditions:** Conditions like sinus infections, acid reflux, and sleep apnea can worsen asthma and should be treated.
* **Tracking Asthma:**  Regularly monitor symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF) using a peak flow meter, and attend scheduled checkups with your doctor.  PEF measurements help assess lung function and can provide early warning of an asthma attack.

**Special Considerations:**

Treatment may be adjusted for specific groups, including:

* **Children:** Diagnosis can be challenging in young children.  Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment, but growth may be monitored.
* **Older Adults:**  Drug interactions with other medications are a concern.
* **Pregnant Women:**  Asthma control is crucial during pregnancy.  Asthma medications are generally considered safe.
* **Individuals with Exercise-Induced Asthma:**  Pre-exercise medication and warm-up routines can help.
* **Individuals undergoing surgery:**  Inform your surgeon about your asthma to minimize potential complications.

What are the symptoms of Type 1 plasminogen deficiency ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Type 1 plasminogen deficiency? Type 1 plasminogen deficiency causes reduced levels of functional plasminogen. The rare inflammatory disease mainly affects the mucous membrances in different body sites. Although the symptoms and their severity may vary from person to person, the most common clinical manifestation is ligneous conjunctivitis, characterized by development of fibrin-rich, woodlike ('ligneous') pseudomembranous lesions. Involvement of the cornea may result in blindness. Other, less common manifestations are ligenous gingivitis, otitis media, ligneous bronchitis and pneumonia, involvement of the gastrointestinal or female genital tract, juvenile colloid milium of the skin (condition in which clear papules develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin), and congenital hydrocephalus.

Here's a breakdown of the symptoms, incorporating the provided information and expanding on it:

**Major Symptoms (frequently observed):**

* **Abnormal blistering of the skin (90%):** This is the hallmark symptom of all EBS subtypes. In EBS-DM, blisters are often clustered and tend to be more severe on the palms and soles (palmoplantar involvement). They can also occur on other areas of the body.  The blisters are intraepidermal, meaning they form within the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis).
* **Abnormality of the fingernails (90%):**  Nail dystrophy and dysplasia are common. Nails may be thickened, discolored, ridged, or prone to shedding.
* **Subcutaneous hemorrhage (90%):**  Bleeding beneath the skin, often appearing as small red or purple spots (petechiae) or larger bruises, can occur within or around the blisters.

**Moderate Symptoms (less frequent but still significant):**

* **Palmoplantar keratoderma/hyperkeratosis (50%):** Thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. This can range from mild to severe and may contribute to painful walking.
* **Skin ulcers (50%):**  Open sores that develop from ruptured blisters, particularly in areas subject to friction or pressure. These ulcers can be painful and are susceptible to infection.

**Less Common Symptoms:**

* **Abnormality of skin pigmentation (7.5%):** Changes in skin color, such as hyperpigmentation (darkening) or hypopigmentation (lightening), can occur at sites of healed blisters.
* **Abnormality of the oral cavity (7.5%):** Blistering can sometimes affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, causing pain and difficulty eating.
* **Constipation (7.5%):** While not a direct skin manifestation, constipation can occur, possibly related to pain and discomfort associated with blistering, or potentially due to dietary restrictions.
* **Feeding difficulties in infancy (7.5%):** Oral blistering can make sucking and swallowing painful for infants, leading to feeding problems.
* **Neoplasm of the skin (7.5%):**  A small increased risk of skin cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, has been reported in some individuals with EBS, though this is less common in EBS-DM compared to other subtypes like EBS-Kindler syndrome.

**Other Features (frequency not specified):**

* **Atrophic scars (5%):** Thin, depressed scars that can develop after blisters heal.
* **Autosomal dominant inheritance:** This means that only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the condition.  It is often inherited from a parent who also has EBS-DM.
* **Growth delay:** Though not always present, some children with EBS-DM may experience slower growth than expected.
* **Milia:** Tiny white cysts that can appear on the skin, particularly in newborns.
* **Neonatal onset:** Symptoms typically appear at birth or shortly thereafter.


It's important to note that the severity and combination of symptoms can vary widely, even within families with the same genetic mutation.  A definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing to identify the specific mutation in the *KRT5* or *KRT14* genes, which encode keratin proteins essential for skin integrity.

This information should not be considered medical advice.  If you suspect you or someone you know may have EBS-DM, it is crucial to consult with a dermatologist or geneticist for proper diagnosis and management.",0.8176,0.4272,0.129,0.2136,19.2005
What is (are) acral peeling skin syndrome ?,"Acral peeling skin syndrome is a skin disorder characterized by painless peeling of the top layer of skin. The term ""acral"" refers to the fact that the skin peeling in this condition is most apparent on the hands and feet. Occasionally, peeling also occurs on the arms and legs. The peeling is usually evident from birth, although the condition can also begin in childhood or later in life. Skin peeling is made worse by exposure to heat, humidity and other forms of moisture, and friction. The underlying skin may be temporarily red and itchy, but it typically heals without scarring. Acral peeling skin syndrome is not associated with any other health problems.","Acral peeling skin syndrome (APSS) is a rare, genodermatosis (genetically inherited skin disorder) characterized by painless, superficial peeling of the skin, primarily affecting the hands and feet (acral areas).  While your provided context is largely accurate, some clarifications and additions are important:

* **Types of APSS:**  There are several subtypes of APSS, differentiated by their genetic cause and sometimes by subtle variations in clinical presentation. These include:
    * **APSS type A:**  Caused by mutations in the *TGM5* gene, encoding transglutaminase 5. This is the most common type.
    * **APSS type B:** Caused by mutations in the *SERPINB7* gene, encoding a serine protease inhibitor.
    * **APSS type C:**  Linked to mutations in the *CYP4F22* gene, which plays a role in lipid metabolism.  This type is sometimes referred to as ""peeling skin syndrome, generalized"" as the peeling can be more widespread.
    * **APSS type D:** Caused by mutations in the *PNPLA1* gene.

* **Onset:** While APSS often presents at birth or in early childhood, some forms may manifest later in life.

* **Symptoms:** The hallmark symptom is painless peeling of the stratum corneum (outermost skin layer).  Erythema (redness) and pruritus (itching) can occur, particularly after exposure to friction, moisture, or heat, but are usually transient.  Scarring is generally absent.  The severity of peeling can vary.

* **Associated Health Problems:** While APSS itself is not typically associated with serious systemic health problems, some subtypes, particularly APSS type C, may have associated features like atopic dermatitis or other skin conditions.  It's important to get a proper diagnosis to determine the specific subtype and rule out other peeling skin disorders.

* **Treatment:** There is no specific cure for APSS. Management focuses on minimizing triggers and alleviating symptoms.  Emollients and moisturizers are often recommended to keep the skin hydrated.  Topical corticosteroids may be used for short periods to manage inflammation and itching.  Avoiding excessive friction, heat, and moisture can help reduce peeling episodes.

What are the symptoms of Chromosome 4q deletion ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of chromosome 4q deletion? The signs and symptoms of chromosome 4q deletion vary significantly depending on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Common features that may be shared by affected people include: Distinctive craniofacial features such as a depressed nasal bridge, cleft lip/palate, and micrognathia Skeletal abnormalities including hip dysplasia and malformations of the fingers, toes, or limbs (arms/legs) Heart defects and/or arrhythmias Hypotonia (reduced muscle tone) Seizures Short stature Developmental delay Intellectual disability Metabolic disorders Gastrointestinal problems Kidney abnormalities","The symptoms of Chromosome 4q deletion syndrome are highly variable, depending on the specific portion of the long arm (q) of chromosome 4 that is deleted.  Larger deletions tend to result in more severe symptoms.  The provided context accurately lists many common features.  To organize and clarify, the symptoms can be grouped into the following categories:

**Craniofacial Features:**

* **Depressed nasal bridge:**  A flattened appearance of the bridge of the nose.
* **Cleft lip/palate:**  A split in the lip and/or roof of the mouth.
* **Micrognathia:**  A small lower jaw.

**Skeletal Abnormalities:**

* **Hip dysplasia:**  Abnormal development of the hip joint.
* **Limb malformations:**  Malformations of the fingers, toes, arms, and/or legs.

**Neurological Issues:**

* **Hypotonia:** Reduced muscle tone.
* **Seizures:** Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain.
* **Developmental delay:**  Delayed achievement of developmental milestones.
* **Intellectual disability:**  Impaired cognitive function.

**Other Organ System Involvement:**

* **Heart defects/arrhythmias:**  Problems with the structure or rhythm of the heart.
* **Metabolic disorders:**  Problems with the body's chemical processes.
* **Gastrointestinal problems:**  Issues with the digestive system.
* **Kidney abnormalities:**  Structural or functional problems with the kidneys.
* **Short stature:**  Significantly below average height.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Variability:** Not all individuals with 4q deletion will have all of these symptoms. Some may have only a few mild features, while others may have multiple severe symptoms.
* **Diagnosis:**  Genetic testing is required to confirm a diagnosis of 4q deletion syndrome.
* **Management:** Treatment is focused on managing the specific symptoms present in each individual.  This may involve a multidisciplinary approach with specialists from various medical fields.


While the provided context is a good starting point, further research in reputable medical databases like PubMed and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) can provide more detailed information about specific genes involved and the latest research on 4q deletion syndrome.

What is (are) Best vitelliform macular dystrophy ?,"Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) is a slowly progressive form of macular degeneration. It usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but age of onset and severity of vision loss can vary. Affected people first have normal vision, followed by decreased central visual acuity and distorted vision (metamorphopsia). Peripheral vision is not affected. BVMD is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, but autosomal recessive inheritance has been reported. The condition is typically caused by mutations in the BEST1 gene; in a few cases the cause is unknown. Treatment is symptomatic and involves the use of low vision aids.","Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), also known as Best disease, is a single, specific inherited eye disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of lipofuscin-like material (called vitelliform material) in the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.  It's important to note that while the prompt mentions ""Best vitelliform macular dystrophies"" in the plural, there is only *one* recognized condition called Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

Here's a breakdown of key features:

* **Inheritance:** Primarily autosomal dominant (meaning only one copy of the mutated gene is needed to cause the disease), though rare autosomal recessive cases exist.  This means if a parent has BVMD, there's a 50% chance their child will inherit it.
* **Genetic Cause:** Most commonly caused by mutations in the *BEST1* gene, which codes for a protein called bestrophin-1.  This protein's function isn't fully understood, but it's thought to play a role in ion transport in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.  The RPE is a layer of cells supporting the photoreceptors in the retina.
* **Progression:**  BVMD typically progresses through distinct stages, often described as:
    * **Previtelliform:**  Normal vision, but subtle abnormalities may be detectable with electrooculography (EOG), a test measuring the electrical potential of the eye.
    * **Vitelliform:**  Accumulation of yellowish material resembling an egg yolk (vitelliform) in the macula. Vision may still be relatively good at this stage.
    * **Pseudohypopyon:**  The vitelliform material may shift within the subretinal space, resembling a hypopyon (accumulation of pus) seen in other eye conditions.
    * **Scrambled Egg:**  The vitelliform material breaks up into smaller pieces.
    * **Atrophic:**  Eventually, the RPE and photoreceptors can atrophy (degenerate), leading to more significant vision loss.

* **Symptoms:**
    * Decreased central visual acuity (blurry vision)
    * Metamorphopsia (distorted vision, straight lines appearing wavy)
    * Scotomas (blind spots in the visual field)
    * Reduced color vision

* **Diagnosis:**  Diagnosis involves a comprehensive eye exam, including:
    * Fundus examination (viewing the back of the eye)
    * Fluorescein angiography (imaging of the retinal blood vessels)
    * Electrooculography (EOG)
    * Genetic testing

* **Treatment:** Currently, there is no cure for BVMD. Treatment is primarily supportive and focuses on managing symptoms and maximizing remaining vision. This may include:
    * Low vision aids (magnifiers, telescopes)
    * Occupational therapy to adapt to vision loss


While the prompt mentions low vision aids as the only treatment, ongoing research is exploring potential future therapies, including gene therapy and pharmacological interventions.  It's important for individuals diagnosed with BVMD to be followed regularly by an ophthalmologist specializing in retinal diseases.

What is (are) Ankle Injuries and Disorders ?,"Your ankle bone and the ends of your two lower leg bones make up the ankle joint. Your ligaments, which connect bones to one another, stabilize and support it. Your muscles and tendons move it.    The most common ankle problems are sprains and fractures. A sprain is an injury to the ligaments. It may take a few weeks to many months to heal completely. A fracture is a break in a bone. You can also injure other parts of the ankle such as tendons, which join muscles to bone, and cartilage, which cushions your joints. Ankle sprains and fractures are common sports injuries.","Ankle injuries and disorders encompass a range of conditions affecting the structures of the ankle joint.  As the provided context explains, the ankle joint is comprised of:

* **Bones:** The distal ends of the tibia (shinbone) and fibula (smaller lower leg bone) form a socket around the talus (ankle bone).
* **Ligaments:** Tough, fibrous bands connecting bones to provide stability.  The most commonly injured are the lateral ligaments on the outside of the ankle.
* **Tendons:** Connect muscles to bones, facilitating movement. The Achilles tendon, which attaches the calf muscles to the heel bone, is a key ankle tendon.
* **Cartilage:**  A smooth, protective tissue covering the bone ends within the joint, allowing for smooth movement and shock absorption.

**Common Ankle Injuries and Disorders:**

* **Sprains:** Injuries to the ligaments, typically caused by overstretching or tearing.  Severity ranges from mild stretching to complete rupture.  Lateral ankle sprains (involving the ligaments on the outside of the ankle) are most common.
* **Fractures:** Breaks in one or more of the bones forming the ankle joint.  Fractures can range from small avulsion fractures (where a ligament pulls off a piece of bone) to complex, displaced fractures.
* **Tendonitis:** Inflammation of a tendon, often caused by overuse or repetitive strain. Achilles tendonitis is a frequent ankle tendonitis.
* **Tendon Ruptures:**  A complete tear of a tendon.  Achilles tendon rupture is a serious injury requiring medical intervention.
* **Cartilage Injuries:** Damage to the articular cartilage within the ankle joint. This can occur from acute trauma or gradually through degenerative processes like osteoarthritis.
* **Osteoarthritis:** A degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.
* **Instability:** Chronic ankle instability can develop after repeated sprains, leading to a feeling of the ankle ""giving way.""
* **Impingement Syndromes:**  Painful conditions caused by tissues being pinched or compressed within the ankle joint.  Anterior (front) and posterior (back) impingement are common types.
* **Nerve Compression:** Nerves around the ankle can become compressed or entrapped, causing pain, numbness, and tingling. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is an example.

This list is not exhaustive, but it covers many of the common ankle injuries and disorders.  Accurate diagnosis and treatment require medical evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional.",0.7247,0.2808,0.0781,0.1641,12.5355
What is (are) Paget's Disease of Bone ?,"Enlarged and Misshapen Bones Paget's disease of bone causes affected bones to become enlarged and misshapen. Our bones are living tissue, and our bodies are constantly breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone. In Paget's disease, however, old bone is broken down and replaced at a faster rate than normal. The new bone is larger and weaker than normal bone. Paget's disease can occur in any bone in the body, but it is most common in the pelvis, spine, skull, and leg bones. It may occur in just one bone or in several bones, but it does not affect the entire skeleton or spread from affected bones to normal bones. Common symptoms include pain, misshapen bones, and a greater chance of broken bones. Complications Paget's disease can also lead to complications, such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, or nervous system problems, depending on which bones are affected. If not treated, Paget's disease can reduce a person's ability to perform activities of daily living, thereby reducing quality of life. Although it is the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, Paget's disease is still uncommon. According to Bone Health and Osteoporosis: A Report of the Surgeon General, an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Paget's disease, or about 1.3 people per 100 men and women age 45-74. The disease is more common in older people and those of Northern European heritage. Men are more likely than women to have the disease. Cause is Unknown Paget's disease is named after the British surgeon, Sir James Paget, who first identified the disease in 1877. Researchers are not sure what causes it. Heredity may be a factor in some cases. Research suggests that a close relative of someone with Paget's disease is seven times more likely to develop the disease than someone without an affected relative. However, most people with Paget's disease do not have any relatives with the disease. Researchers think the disease also may be caused by other factors, such as a slow-acting virus. A Treatable Disease The good news is that Paget's disease of bone is treatable, especially if it is diagnosed early. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved several medications that can stop or slow the disease's progression. In some cases, surgery can help patients manage the symptoms and complications of the disease.","Paget's disease of bone is a chronic metabolic bone disorder characterized by accelerated bone remodeling.  This process, where old bone is broken down and replaced with new bone, occurs at an abnormally high rate in Paget's disease. The newly formed bone is structurally disorganized, larger, weaker, and more vascular than normal bone, leading to various complications.

While the exact cause of Paget's disease remains unknown, several factors are suspected:

* **Genetic Predisposition:**  A family history of Paget's disease significantly increases the risk, suggesting a genetic component.  While specific genes have been identified, not everyone with these genes develops the disease.
* **Viral Infection:** Some research suggests a link between certain viral infections (e.g., paramyxoviruses) and the development of Paget's disease, although this remains a topic of ongoing investigation.
* **Environmental Factors:**  Other potential contributing factors are being explored, but none have been definitively established.

Paget's disease can affect any bone but is most commonly found in the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones of the legs. It can affect one or multiple bones but does *not* spread from affected bones to healthy bones.  The disease is not systemic, meaning it doesn't affect the entire skeleton.

Common symptoms include:

* **Bone pain:** This is often the most prominent symptom.
* **Bone deformity:**  Affected bones can become enlarged and misshapen.
* **Increased risk of fractures:** Due to the weakened bone structure.
* **Other symptoms:** Depending on the location of the affected bones, complications such as arthritis, headaches, hearing loss, and nerve compression can occur.

Although the provided text mentions it being the second most common bone disease after osteoporosis, this is debated. Osteoarthritis is generally considered the second most common.  Regardless, Paget's disease is relatively uncommon, affecting approximately 1 million people in the U.S., primarily older adults and those of Northern European descent.  Men are slightly more affected than women.

Importantly, Paget's disease is treatable.  Several medications are available that can effectively slow or stop the progression of the disease.  In some cases, surgery may be necessary to manage complications. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing long-term complications and maintaining quality of life.",0.8128,0.5893,0.2693,0.3181,11.5714

This suggests that the actual number of affected individuals, while likely higher than the reported cases, is still very small.  It is important to remember that the lack of reported cases does not necessarily equate to non-existence, especially with rare genetic disorders where diagnosis can be challenging.",0.7132,0.2989,0.1176,0.2299,4.0667
What is (are) 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency ?,"17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiencyis an inherited condition that affects male sexual development. People with this condition are genetically male and have testes, but do not produce enough testosterone. Most people with this condition are born with external genitalia that appear female. In some cases, the external genitalia are ambiguous or appear male but are abnormal in size and/or appearance. During puberty, people with this condition typically go on to develop male secondary sex characteristics, such as increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, and development of male pattern body hair. 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 deficiency is caused by mutations in the HSD17B3 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.","17-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 (17β-HSD3) deficiency is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder of sex development (DSD) affecting individuals with a 46,XY (typically male) karyotype.  It disrupts the biosynthesis of testosterone in the testes.  While these individuals have testes and are genetically male, the deficiency in testosterone production leads to undervirilization of the external genitalia during fetal development.

Here's a breakdown of the key features:

* **Genetic Basis:**  Caused by mutations in the *HSD17B3* gene located on chromosome 9q22. This gene encodes the 17β-HSD3 enzyme, which is crucial for the final step in testosterone biosynthesis within the testes.  Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to testosterone.

* **Hormonal Impact:**  The deficiency in 17β-HSD3 leads to a reduced ability to produce testosterone.  While other androgens like androstenedione may be elevated, they are less potent than testosterone in driving male sexual development.

* **Clinical Presentation:**
    * **At birth:**  Most affected individuals are born with female-appearing external genitalia. Some may have ambiguous genitalia, while others may have male-appearing genitalia that are underdeveloped or abnormal.
    * **Puberty:**  Despite the lack of testosterone during early development,  the increased production of androstenedione at puberty can be peripherally converted to testosterone in other tissues. This often leads to the development of male secondary sexual characteristics, including increased muscle mass, deepening of the voice, growth of the phallus, and male-pattern hair growth.  Breast development is typically absent or minimal.
    * **Fertility:**  Affected individuals are typically infertile.

* **Inheritance:**  Inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that both parents must carry a mutated copy of the *HSD17B3* gene for their child to be affected.  If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance with each pregnancy that the child will have the condition.

* **Diagnosis:**
    * Clinical examination
    * Hormone testing (elevated androstenedione and low testosterone levels)
    * Genetic testing to identify mutations in the *HSD17B3* gene

* **Management:**  Management options often involve hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with testosterone to induce and maintain virilization, particularly if the individual identifies as male.  Surgical interventions may be considered to correct the appearance of the external genitalia.  Psychological support is also crucial, given the potential impact on gender identity and psychosocial development.

What is (are) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ?,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. At first, this causes mild muscle problems. Some people notice       -  Trouble walking or running     -  Trouble writing     -  Speech problems       Eventually, you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail, you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help, but most people with ALS die from respiratory failure.     The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families, but usually it strikes at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and, sometimes, prolong survival.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement.  

Specifically, ALS targets motor neurons. These neurons transmit signals from the brain to the muscles, enabling movement. As motor neurons degenerate and die in ALS, the brain loses its ability to initiate and control muscle movement.  This leads to a gradual weakening and atrophy of muscles, impacting essential functions like walking, speaking, swallowing, and eventually, breathing.

While the provided context accurately describes the progression and typical symptoms of ALS, it's important to add some further details:

* **Types of ALS:**  ALS is broadly classified into sporadic ALS (most common, no known family history) and familial ALS (inherited, accounting for about 5-10% of cases).
* **Early Symptoms:** Early symptoms can be subtle and vary among individuals.  They may include muscle twitching (fasciculations), cramping, stiffness, weakness in a limb, slurred speech, or difficulty swallowing.
* **Diagnosis:**  Diagnosing ALS involves a combination of neurological examinations, electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out other conditions.
* **Treatment:** While there is no cure for ALS, treatments focus on managing symptoms, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life.  Riluzole and edaravone are FDA-approved medications that may modestly extend survival.  Supportive care, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, respiratory support, and nutritional assistance, is crucial.
* **Prognosis:**  The prognosis for ALS is generally poor, with most people living 2-5 years after diagnosis. However, some individuals live much longer.

What is (are) Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ?,"Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by myoclonic jerks (quick jerks of the arms or legs), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), and sometimes, absence seizures. The seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning. Seizures can be triggered by lack of sleep, extreme fatigue, stress, or alcohol consumption. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The exact cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy remains unknown, but genetics likely plays a role. Although patients usually require lifelong treatment with anticonvulsants, their overall prognosis is generally good.","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), sometimes referred to as Janz syndrome, is a generalized epilepsy syndrome characterized by the hallmark triad of:

1. **Myoclonic Jerks:** These are brief, shock-like, involuntary muscle contractions. In JME, they typically affect both arms and sometimes the legs, often occurring shortly after awakening.  They can be subtle or forceful enough to cause objects to be dropped.

2. **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (GTCS):**  These are the most dramatic seizure type, involving loss of consciousness, stiffening of the body (tonic phase), followed by rhythmic jerking of the limbs (clonic phase).

3. **Absence Seizures (Sometimes):**  These are brief episodes of staring and unresponsiveness, often lasting only a few seconds.  While less common in JME than the other two seizure types, they can occur.

**Key Features of JME:**

* **Age of Onset:** Typically between 8 and 26 years, with a peak around puberty (12-18 years).
* **Triggers:** Seizures can be provoked by sleep deprivation, fatigue, stress, alcohol consumption, and sometimes flashing lights (photosensitivity).
* **Morning Predominance:** Seizures are more likely to occur shortly after waking up.
* **Normal Development:** Individuals with JME usually have normal neurological development and intelligence before the onset of seizures.
* **Genetics:**  JME has a strong genetic component, although the exact genes involved are still being investigated.  Multiple genes likely contribute, and it's often seen to run in families.
* **Diagnosis:** Diagnosis is based on clinical history, electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (which typically show generalized polyspike-wave discharges), and sometimes genetic testing.
* **Treatment:**  Lifelong treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, and topiramate, is usually required.  Choosing the right AED depends on individual factors and potential side effects.
* **Prognosis:** With appropriate medication and lifestyle management (avoiding triggers), most individuals with JME can achieve good seizure control and lead fulfilling lives. However, sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a risk in all epilepsy syndromes, including JME, and emphasizes the importance of optimal seizure control.

How to diagnose Bile Duct Cancer (Cholangiocarcinoma) ?,"Tests that examine the bile ducts and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer. Procedures that make pictures of the bile ducts and the nearby area help diagnose bile duct cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bile ducts or to distant parts of the body is called staging.    In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the bile duct cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer are usually done at the same time.   The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of these substances can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by bile duct cancer.    -   Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.    -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. Higher than normal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may mean there is bile duct cancer.    -   Ultrasound exam : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, and pancreatic duct.
                    Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer. Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Different procedures may be used to obtain the sample of cells and tissue. The type of procedure used depends on whether the patient is well enough to have surgery.    Types of biopsy procedures include the following:         -   Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen, such as the bile ducts and liver, to check for signs of cancer. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples to be checked for signs of cancer.    -   Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This procedure may be used when a patient cannot have surgery.    -   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes bile duct cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach and into the small intestine. Dye is injected through the endoscope (thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) into the bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. This procedure may be used when a patient cannot have surgery.","Diagnosing bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a complex process involving several imaging, blood, and tissue-based tests. The goal is not only to confirm the presence of cancer but also to determine its location, extent (stage), and resectability (whether it can be surgically removed).  Here's a structured overview of the diagnostic process:

**1. Initial Evaluation:**

* **Physical Exam and History:**  A thorough physical exam, including palpation of the abdomen, is conducted to assess for signs like jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), abdominal masses, or tenderness.  A detailed medical history is taken, focusing on risk factors, symptoms, and past medical conditions.
* **Liver Function Tests (LFTs):** Elevated levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase can indicate bile duct obstruction, a common sign of cholangiocarcinoma.  Other LFTs can also help assess liver function.
* **Tumor Markers:** While not diagnostic on their own, elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 can suggest the presence of bile duct cancer and may be used for monitoring disease progression.

**2. Imaging Studies:**

* **Ultrasound:**  Often the first imaging test performed, ultrasound can detect dilated bile ducts and masses in the liver or surrounding areas.  It's non-invasive and relatively inexpensive.
* **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan:** CT scans provide more detailed cross-sectional images of the abdomen, helping to visualize the tumor, assess its size and location, and identify any spread to lymph nodes or other organs.
* **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** MRI offers even greater detail than CT, particularly in visualizing soft tissues.  It can help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions and assess vascular involvement.
* **Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP):** This specialized MRI technique specifically focuses on the biliary and pancreatic ducts, providing detailed images of the bile duct system and helping to pinpoint the location and extent of the obstruction.

**3. Tissue Diagnosis (Biopsy):**

Obtaining a tissue sample for pathological examination is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. Several biopsy methods can be used:

* **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):**  A thin, flexible tube (endoscope) is inserted through the mouth, esophagus, and stomach into the small intestine.  Dye is injected into the bile ducts, and X-rays are taken.  During ERCP, tissue samples can be collected, and stents can be placed to relieve bile duct obstruction.
* **Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC):** A needle is inserted through the skin and into the liver to access the bile ducts.  Dye is injected, and X-rays are taken.  Tissue samples can be obtained during this procedure, and drainage catheters can be placed if necessary.
* **Laparoscopy:** A minimally invasive surgical procedure where small incisions are made in the abdomen to insert a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube with a camera).  This allows direct visualization of the bile ducts and surrounding organs, and tissue samples can be collected.  Laparoscopy can also be used to determine the extent of the cancer and assess resectability.


**4. Staging:**

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, staging is performed to determine the extent of the cancer's spread. This typically involves imaging studies (CT, MRI) and may also include other tests, such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans.  Staging is crucial for treatment planning.

**Important Considerations:**

* The specific diagnostic approach may vary depending on the patient's individual circumstances, the suspected location of the tumor (intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal), and the availability of resources.
* Multidisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists is essential for accurate diagnosis and optimal management of cholangiocarcinoma.

What are the symptoms of White sponge nevus of cannon ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of White sponge nevus of cannon? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for White sponge nevus of cannon. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Oral leukoplakia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","White Sponge Nevus (WSN) of Cannon, also known as Cannon's disease or familial white folded dysplasia, primarily presents with oral leukoplakia. This appears as thickened, white, spongy or corrugated plaques on the mucous membranes of the mouth.  While the provided text mentions ""abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis"" and ""autosomal dominant inheritance,"" these are not symptoms but rather a characteristic of the underlying genetic cause and inheritance pattern of the condition.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Oral Leukoplakia:** This is the hallmark symptom of WSN. The lesions are usually bilateral and symmetrical, most commonly affecting the buccal mucosa (inside of the cheeks).  They can also involve the tongue, floor of the mouth, and other oral surfaces.  While they may appear alarming, these lesions are benign and typically asymptomatic.  However, the thickened tissue can sometimes cause a feeling of fullness or mild discomfort.

It's important to note:

* **Asymptomatic in many cases:**  Many individuals with WSN experience no discomfort or other symptoms besides the visible leukoplakia.
* **Age of onset:** The lesions often appear in childhood or adolescence, but can develop later in life.
* **Benign condition:** WSN is not cancerous and does not increase the risk of oral cancer.  However, the appearance of oral leukoplakia can be similar to other conditions, some of which are precancerous.  Therefore, a biopsy is often recommended to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.

The information provided about autosomal dominant inheritance indicates that the condition is caused by a genetic mutation passed down from one parent.  This means that if one parent has WSN, there is a 50% chance that each of their children will inherit the condition.  However, the severity of the leukoplakia can vary even within the same family.


While the provided text mentions ""abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis,"" there are no specific metabolic abnormalities consistently associated with WSN.  This mention likely refers to the disruption in the normal process of epithelial cell maturation caused by the genetic mutation.",0.7199,0.395,0.05,0.1744,11.7628
What causes Glaucoma ?,"Nearly 2.7 million people have glaucoma, a leading cause of blindness in the United States. Although anyone can get glaucoma, some people are at higher risk. They include - African-Americans over age 40  - everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos  - people with a family history of glaucoma. African-Americans over age 40 everyone over age 60, especially Hispanics/Latinos people with a family history of glaucoma.  In addition to age, eye pressure is a risk factor. Whether you develop glaucoma depends on the level of pressure your optic nerve can tolerate without being damaged. This level is different for each person. Thats why a comprehensive dilated eye exam is very important. It can help your eye care professional determine what level of eye pressure is normal for you. Another risk factor for optic nerve damage relates to blood pressure. Thus, it is important to also make sure that your blood pressure is at a proper level for your body by working with your medical doctor. (Watch the animated video to learn more about the causes of glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.)","Glaucoma is primarily caused by damage to the optic nerve, often associated with increased intraocular pressure (IOP).  While the exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, the following contribute to optic nerve damage in glaucoma:

* **Elevated Intraocular Pressure (IOP):**  The eye continuously produces a fluid called aqueous humor, which nourishes the eye and maintains its shape.  This fluid normally drains through a mesh-like structure called the trabecular meshwork.  If the drainage system is impaired, the fluid builds up, increasing IOP.  This elevated pressure can compress and damage the optic nerve fibers.  However, it's important to note that some individuals can develop glaucoma with normal IOP (normal-tension glaucoma), and others can tolerate high IOP without developing glaucoma.

* **Reduced Blood Flow to the Optic Nerve:**  Decreased blood supply to the optic nerve can make it more susceptible to damage from IOP or other factors.  Conditions like low blood pressure, diabetes, and atherosclerosis can contribute to reduced optic nerve blood flow.

* **Other Contributing Factors:** While less direct, other factors can increase the risk of developing glaucoma:

    * **Age:**  The risk of glaucoma increases with age.
    * **Race/Ethnicity:** African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and people of Asian descent are at higher risk.
    * **Family History:** A family history of glaucoma significantly increases your risk.
    * **Medical Conditions:**  Diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure, and other systemic conditions can increase risk.
    * **Thin Cornea:** A thinner central cornea is associated with a higher risk of glaucoma.
    * **Myopia (Nearsightedness):** High myopia can be a risk factor.
    * **Eye Injuries or Trauma:** Past eye injuries can sometimes contribute to glaucoma development later in life.
    * **Long-Term Corticosteroid Use:**  Prolonged use of corticosteroids, especially eye drops, can increase IOP and glaucoma risk.

Who is at risk for Neuroblastoma? ?,The risk factors for neuroblastoma are not known.,"While the exact causes of neuroblastoma remain unknown, meaning we can't definitively say *why* some children develop it and others don't, certain factors are associated with a *higher risk* of developing the disease.  It's important to distinguish between a causative factor (something that directly *causes* the disease) and a risk factor (something that *increases the likelihood* of developing the disease).

Here's what we know about risk factors for neuroblastoma:

* **Age:** Neuroblastoma primarily affects young children, with most cases diagnosed before the age of 5.  It is rarely seen in children older than 10.
* **Family History:** While neuroblastoma is generally not considered a hereditary cancer (meaning it's not usually passed down directly from parents), a small percentage of cases appear to have a familial component.  Having a family history of neuroblastoma slightly increases the risk.  However, the vast majority of children with neuroblastoma do not have a family history of the disease.
* **Certain Genetic Conditions:**  A few rare genetic syndromes, such as Hirschsprung's disease, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and central congenital hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), have been linked to a slightly increased risk of neuroblastoma.
* **Race:**  Neuroblastoma is slightly more common in Caucasian children than in children of other races.

It's crucial to understand that having one or more of these risk factors does *not* mean a child will definitely develop neuroblastoma. Most children with these risk factors will *not* develop the disease.  Conversely, children without any known risk factors can still develop neuroblastoma.

Because the underlying causes are still being researched, there are no known preventative measures for neuroblastoma.

What are the treatments for Birdshot chorioretinopathy ?,"What treatments are available for birdshot chorioretinopathy? Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for birdshot chorioretinopathy.  Because this condition is rare, there are no established guidelines for treatment.  Treatment is determined based on the severity of each affected individual's symptoms.  Because birdshot chorioretinopathy is suspected to be an autoimmune disease, therapies aim to regulate the body's immune response.  Therapies may include corticosteroids such as prednisone (by injection or medication taken by mouth) or medications that suppress the immune system such as cyclosporine.","Birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR) treatments aim to control inflammation and preserve vision, as there is no known cure.  Treatment is individualized based on symptom severity and often involves immunosuppression.  While there are no established treatment guidelines due to the rarity of the condition, common approaches include:

* **Corticosteroids:**  These are often the first line of treatment to reduce inflammation.  They can be administered:
    * **Systemically:** Oral prednisone is frequently used, but carries the risk of significant side effects with long-term use.
    * **Locally:**  Intravitreal injections of corticosteroids can deliver medication directly to the eye, potentially minimizing systemic side effects, but may require repeated injections.

* **Immunosuppressive agents:** When corticosteroids alone are insufficient or side effects are intolerable, other immunosuppressants may be used.
    * **Cyclosporine A:** This is a commonly used immunosuppressant in BSCR.  It can have significant side effects and requires careful monitoring.
    * **Other immunosuppressants:**  Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus are sometimes used, particularly in cases where cyclosporine is ineffective or poorly tolerated.  These also require careful monitoring due to potential side effects.

* **Biologic therapies:**  Targeted therapies like anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab) and other biologics targeting specific immune pathways are increasingly being used, especially in refractory cases.

* **Other potential therapies:** Research is ongoing to explore other treatment options, including:
    * **Vitrectomy:**  Surgical removal of the vitreous humor may be considered in cases with significant vitreous inflammation or complications like macular edema.
    * **Implant therapy:**  Sustained-release implants containing corticosteroids or other medications are being investigated.


It is crucial for patients with BSCR to be under the care of an experienced ophthalmologist specializing in uveitis and retinal diseases.  Regular monitoring is essential to assess treatment response and manage potential side effects.

You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Intrauterine growth retardation 5% Nonimmune hydrops fetalis 5% Abnormality of the amniotic fluid - Autosomal recessive inheritance - Cholecystitis - Cholelithiasis - Chronic hemolytic anemia - Increased red cell osmotic fragility - Jaundice - Reticulocytosis - Splenomegaly - Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Pyruvate kinase deficiency primarily manifests as **hemolytic anemia**, meaning red blood cells are broken down prematurely.  This leads to a cascade of symptoms including:

* **Jaundice:** Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (icterus) due to the buildup of bilirubin, a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown.
* **Pallor:** Pale skin due to reduced red blood cell count.
* **Fatigue and lethargy:**  Resulting from decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
* **Splenomegaly:** Enlarged spleen, as it works overtime to remove damaged red blood cells.
* **Gallstones (cholelithiasis and cholecystitis):**  Increased bilirubin can contribute to gallstone formation.

**Severity and Age of Onset:**

Symptom severity varies widely.  Some individuals experience mild, chronic anemia, while others have severe, life-threatening complications.

* **In utero:**  Severe cases can present as hydrops fetalis, a dangerous buildup of fluid in the fetus.
* **Newborns:** Prolonged jaundice and anemia are common initial signs.
* **Children:** Intermittent jaundice and pallor are typical.
* **Adults:** While the anemia may stabilize, episodes can be triggered by infections, stress, and pregnancy.

**Other potential symptoms (less common or with variable frequency):**

* **Intrauterine growth retardation:**  Slowed fetal growth.
* **Increased red cell osmotic fragility:** Red blood cells are more susceptible to rupture.
* **Reticulocytosis:** Increased number of immature red blood cells in circulation, indicating the bone marrow's attempt to compensate for the anemia.
* **Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia:** Elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood.
* **Abnormality of the amniotic fluid:**  May be observed in severe cases affecting the fetus.


It's important to note that the provided context mentions the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Orphanet as sources for symptom frequency.  However, the specific frequencies listed are not comprehensive and should be interpreted with caution.

What are the treatments for Narcolepsy ?,"How might narcolepsy be treated? There is currently no cure for narcolepsy, but some of the symptoms can be managed with medications and lifestyle changes. Most affected people improve if they maintain a regular sleep schedule, usually 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Scheduled naps during the day also may help. Other measures that may help include participating in an exercise program; receiving emotional support and career or vocational counseling; and avoiding high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, which may make symptoms worse. Common-sense measures should be taken to enhance sleep quality (such as avoiding heavy meals before bed time). Treatment with medications involves the use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These medications help reduce daytime sleepiness and improve this symptom in 65-85% of affected people. Two types of antidepressant drugs (tricyclics, and selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors) are effective in controlling cataplexy in many people. Sodium oxybate (a strong sedative taken during the night) may also be used to treat narcolepsy. You can view detailed information about the treatment of narcolepsy on Medscape's Web site.","Narcolepsy treatment focuses on managing symptoms, as there is no cure.  Treatments generally fall into these categories:

**1. Lifestyle Modifications:**

* **Regular Sleep Schedule:**  Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule with 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep per night is crucial.
* **Scheduled Daytime Naps:** Short, planned naps can help manage excessive daytime sleepiness.
* **Regular Exercise:**  A regular exercise program can improve sleep quality.
* **Emotional Support and Counseling:**  Addressing the emotional and social impact of narcolepsy is important.
* **Avoidance of Alcohol and Drugs:** These substances can exacerbate symptoms.
* **Sleep Hygiene Practices:**  Adopting good sleep hygiene habits, such as avoiding heavy meals before bedtime, can improve sleep quality.

**2. Pharmacologic Interventions:**

* **Central Nervous System (CNS) Stimulants:**  These medications, such as modafinil and armodafinil, are commonly used to reduce daytime sleepiness and improve alertness.  They are effective in a significant portion of patients (65-85%).  Methylphenidate and amphetamines may also be used but carry a higher risk of side effects and potential for abuse.
* **Antidepressants:** Certain antidepressants, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), can help control cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions).  Examples include venlafaxine, fluoxetine, and clomipramine.
* **Sodium Oxybate (Xyrem):**  This medication is a strong sedative taken at night to improve nighttime sleep quality and reduce cataplexy and daytime sleepiness. It requires careful monitoring due to potential side effects.


It's important to note that treatment is individualized based on the specific symptoms and severity of narcolepsy. A physician should be consulted for diagnosis and to develop a personalized treatment plan.",0.8574,0.4966,0.2404,0.3296,10.7196
What is (are) Fragile X syndrome ?,"Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females.  Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of autism spectrum disorders that affect communication and social interaction. Seizures occur in about 15 percent of males and about 5 percent of females with fragile X syndrome.  Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after puberty.","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the *FMR1* gene located on the X chromosome. This gene normally produces a protein called FMRP (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein) that is essential for brain development.  In FXS, the *FMR1* gene is altered, most commonly by an expansion of a specific DNA segment called a CGG repeat. This expansion leads to reduced or absent production of FMRP, disrupting normal brain development and function.

The severity of FXS is generally correlated with the number of CGG repeats:

* **Normal:** 5-44 CGG repeats
* **Intermediate or ""gray zone"":** 45-54 CGG repeats (generally no symptoms, but may have increased risk of certain conditions)
* **Premutation:** 55-200 CGG repeats (may have some associated symptoms like Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or Fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI))
* **Full mutation:** >200 CGG repeats (typically results in FXS)

Because males only have one X chromosome, a full mutation on their single X chromosome almost always results in FXS. Females have two X chromosomes, so if one X chromosome has a full mutation, the other X chromosome can often partially compensate. This is why females with FXS tend to have milder and more variable symptoms than males.

As described in the provided context, FXS can cause a range of developmental and cognitive problems, including:

* **Intellectual disability:** Ranging from mild to moderate in males and affecting about one-third of females.
* **Speech and language delays:** Often noticeable by age 2.
* **Behavioral challenges:** Including anxiety, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attention deficit disorder (ADD).
* **Autism spectrum disorder features:** Present in about one-third of individuals with FXS.
* **Seizures:** More common in males (15%) than females (5%).
* **Characteristic physical features:**  Becoming more apparent with age, including a long and narrow face, large ears, prominent jaw and forehead, flexible fingers, flat feet, and enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) in post-pubertal males.


It's important to note that the severity and specific symptoms of FXS can vary widely, even within families.  Diagnosis is typically confirmed through genetic testing to analyze the *FMR1* gene for CGG repeat expansion.

How to diagnose Catamenial pneumothorax ?,How might catamenial pneumothorax be diagnosed? The diagnosis should be suspected in women of reproductive age who have several episodes of spontaneous lung collapse (pneumothoraces) and have endometriosis. Medical thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracoscopy may confirm the diagnosis.,"The diagnosis of catamenial pneumothorax is a multi-step process, combining a high index of suspicion based on patient history with confirmatory imaging and, ideally, surgical visualization.

1. **Suspicion based on clinical presentation:**  The primary indicator is the recurrence of pneumothorax in women of reproductive age, coinciding with menstruation (typically within 72 hours of onset of menses).  A history of endometriosis, though not always present, significantly strengthens the suspicion.  Symptoms of pneumothorax, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and decreased breath sounds on the affected side, will also be present.

2. **Imaging studies:**

    * **Chest X-ray:**  This is the initial imaging modality used to confirm the presence of pneumothorax itself, revealing collapsed lung tissue.  However, it cannot directly diagnose catamenial pneumothorax.
    * **CT scan:**  A chest CT, particularly with high-resolution thin sections, can provide more detailed information about the lung parenchyma, identify small blebs or bullae, and sometimes visualize diaphragmatic defects or pleural abnormalities. While helpful, it still doesn't definitively diagnose the catamenial nature of the pneumothorax.

3. **Surgical visualization (Gold Standard):**

    * **Medical thoracoscopy or Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS):** This is the most definitive method for diagnosing catamenial pneumothorax.  VATS allows direct visualization of the pleural cavity and can identify characteristic findings such as diaphragmatic defects (often small fenestrations or blebs), pleural endometriosis implants, and passage of air from the abdomen to the pleural space.  It also allows for simultaneous treatment, such as resection of endometrial implants and repair of diaphragmatic defects.

4. **Hormonal evaluation:** While not diagnostic, assessing hormonal status can be helpful, especially if endometriosis is suspected.  However, normal hormonal levels do not exclude the diagnosis.

5. **Exclusion of other causes:**  It's crucial to rule out other potential causes of recurrent pneumothorax, such as primary spontaneous pneumothorax (related to blebs or bullae), secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (due to underlying lung disease), traumatic pneumothorax, and iatrogenic pneumothorax.


In summary, diagnosing catamenial pneumothorax requires a combination of clinical suspicion based on the temporal relationship between menses and pneumothorax episodes, imaging to confirm the pneumothorax, and ideally, VATS for definitive diagnosis and concurrent treatment.  


It's important to note that a delay in diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity.  Therefore, a high index of suspicion is warranted in women of reproductive age presenting with recurrent pneumothorax.",0.7948,0.125,0.058,0.0913,12.4657
What causes Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy ?,"What causes autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy? The cause of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is not fully understood. An autoimmune component is presumed, as the body's own immune system damages a receptor in the autonomic ganglia (part of the peripheral autonomic nerve fiber). In one to two-thirds of affected individuals, this condition is associated with high titers of ganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody (g-AchR antibody).. About 60% of cases follow an infection or other illness.","Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG) is believed to be caused by an autoimmune process targeting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) within the autonomic ganglia.  While the exact trigger for this autoimmune response remains unclear, the current understanding suggests the following:

* **Autoantibodies against ganglionic acetylcholine receptors (g-AChR antibodies):**  The presence of these antibodies is a key diagnostic marker for AAG.  These antibodies disrupt the normal transmission of nerve signals across the autonomic ganglia, leading to the characteristic dysautonomia seen in AAG. While the presence of these antibodies is strongly associated with AAG, not everyone with the antibodies develops the condition, suggesting other factors are also involved.  (Vernino et al., 2000)

* **Possible antecedent illness or infection:** In a significant proportion of cases (around 60%), AAG appears to develop following an infection or other illness. This suggests that the initial illness may trigger the autoimmune response in susceptible individuals, possibly through molecular mimicry or other mechanisms. However, the specific infections or illnesses that trigger AAG are not consistently identified.

* **Genetic predisposition:** While not definitively proven, a genetic component is suspected in some cases, potentially influencing an individual's susceptibility to developing AAG after an environmental trigger like an infection. More research is needed in this area.

In summary, AAG is likely a multifactorial condition with autoimmunity playing a central role. The presence of g-AChR antibodies is a strong indicator, and antecedent illness may act as a trigger in some individuals.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and identify potential genetic risk factors.

Symptoms can vary depending on the type of priapism (ischemic/low-flow or nonischemic/high-flow).

**Ischemic Priapism (Low-flow):** This is the more common and dangerous type.

* **Rigid penile erection:**  The corpus cavernosa (the erectile tissue within the penis) becomes rigid and tender.
* **Progressive penile pain:**  The pain typically increases over time.
* **Absence of sexual desire:** The erection is not related to sexual arousal.
* **Distal penis (glans) may be soft:**  While the shaft of the penis is rigid, the tip may remain soft.

**Nonischemic Priapism (High-flow):** This type is less common and usually less painful.

* **Persistent erection:** The erection is less rigid than in ischemic priapism.
* **Usually painless or minimally painful:**  Discomfort is usually mild.
* **The penis is typically not fully rigid:** It may be partially erect and engorged.

"How to diagnose Parasites - Lice - Pubic ""Crab"" Lice ?","Pubic lice are short and crab-like and appear very different from head and body lice. Pubic lice infestation is diagnosed by finding a Ã¢â¬ÅcrabÃ¢â¬ï¿½ louse or eggs on hair in the pubic region or, less commonly, elsewhere on the body (eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, mustache, armpit, perianal area, groin, trunk, scalp). Although pubic lice and nits can be large enough to be seen with the naked eye, a magnifying lens may be necessary to find lice or eggs.","Diagnosis of pubic lice ( *Phthirus pubis* ), also known as ""crab"" lice, is primarily based on visual identification of the lice or their eggs (nits) on the hair shafts in the pubic region and, less frequently, other coarse body hair.

Here's a breakdown of the diagnostic process:

1. **Visual Inspection:**  Careful examination of the affected area, typically the pubic region, is the primary method.  Adult lice are small, crab-like in appearance, and typically brown or grayish-white.  They can sometimes be seen moving.

2. **Magnification:** While adult lice and nits can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, a magnifying glass or dermatoscope can greatly aid in identification, especially for nits, which are small, oval-shaped, and firmly attached to the hair shaft close to the skin.

3. **Location of Lice and Nits:** Pubic lice are typically found attached to coarse hair in the pubic region.  However, they can occasionally infest other areas with coarse hair, including the eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, mustache, armpits, perianal area, groin, trunk, and, rarely, the scalp.  Finding lice or nits in these areas can also contribute to the diagnosis.

4. **Symptoms:** While visual identification is the key to diagnosis, the presence of symptoms like itching in the affected area can raise suspicion for pubic lice infestation and prompt a closer examination.

5. **Distinguishing from Other Conditions:** It's important to differentiate pubic lice from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as eczema, scabies, or other skin irritations.  The presence of visible lice or nits is crucial for confirming the diagnosis of pubic lice.

If you suspect you have pubic lice, it is recommended to consult a healthcare professional. They can confirm the diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment options.  Self-treatment can be ineffective and may even worsen the condition.

Do you have information about Pancreas Transplantation,"Summary : The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach and in front of your spine. It produces the juices that help break down food and the hormones that help control blood sugar levels. A pancreas transplant is surgery to place a healthy pancreas from a donor into a person with a diseased pancreas. It is mostly done for people with severe type 1 diabetes. It can allow them to give up insulin shots. An experimental procedure called islet cell transplantation transplants only the parts of the pancreas that make insulin.    People who have transplants must take drugs to keep their body from rejecting the new pancreas for the rest of their lives. They must also have regular follow-up care. Because of the risks, it is not a common treatment for type 1 diabetes.","You've provided a good summary of pancreas transplantation.  Here's some additional information, expanding on key aspects:

**Types of Pancreas Transplants:**

* **Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney Transplant (SPK):**  This is the most common type, typically performed for individuals with type 1 diabetes who also have end-stage renal disease (kidney failure).  The diseased kidney and pancreas are replaced simultaneously.  The rationale is that the immunosuppression required to prevent rejection of the kidney also protects the pancreas.
* **Pancreas After Kidney (PAK):**  Performed in patients who have already received a kidney transplant and later develop complications from diabetes or have difficulty managing their blood sugar.
* **Pancreas Transplant Alone (PTA):**  Less common, reserved for individuals with type 1 diabetes and severe hypoglycemic unawareness (unable to sense low blood sugar episodes) or brittle diabetes (difficult-to-control blood sugar levels) who do not require a kidney transplant.
* **Islet Cell Transplantation:** As you mentioned, this experimental procedure involves transplanting only the insulin-producing islet cells from a donor pancreas.  It is less invasive than a whole pancreas transplant but still requires immunosuppression.  It's being investigated as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes, often in conjunction with or following a kidney transplant.

**Candidate Selection:**

Strict criteria exist for pancreas transplant candidacy, including:

* **Type 1 diabetes:**  While occasionally performed for type 2 diabetes with severe complications, it's primarily for type 1.
* **End-stage renal disease (for SPK):** Often the primary reason for SPK.
* **Good overall health:**  Candidates must be able to withstand the surgery and long-term immunosuppression.
* **Absence of other serious medical conditions:**  Conditions like active cancer, severe heart disease, or active infections can disqualify a candidate.
* **Psychological evaluation:**  Assessing the patient's ability to cope with the demands of transplantation and lifelong immunosuppression.

**Risks and Complications:**

Pancreas transplantation carries significant risks, including:

* **Rejection:** The recipient's immune system may attack the transplanted pancreas. Immunosuppressive drugs are necessary to prevent this, but they have their own side effects.
* **Infection:** Immunosuppression increases the risk of infections.
* **Bleeding:**  A risk associated with any major surgery.
* **Thrombosis:** Blood clots can form in the blood vessels supplying the new pancreas.
* **Pancreatitis:** Inflammation of the pancreas.
* **Side effects of immunosuppressants:** These can include increased risk of infections, kidney problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and certain cancers.

**Long-Term Outcomes:**

Successful pancreas transplantation can significantly improve quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes, often leading to insulin independence and better blood sugar control. However, long-term monitoring and adherence to the immunosuppression regimen are crucial for graft survival and overall health.

What is the outlook for Mucopolysaccharidoses ?,"The mucopolysaccharidoses syndromes share many clinical features but have varying degrees of severity. Most individuals with a mucopolysaccharidosis syndrome generally experience a period of normal development followed by a decline in physical and mental function. Longevity is dependent upon the particular syndrome. For example, children with a form of mucopolysaccharidosis called Hurler syndrome often die before age 10 from obstructive airway disease, respiratory infections, or cardiac complications. A child with the type known as Scheie syndrome can live into adulthood, while one with a mild case of the type known as Hunter syndrome may live into his or her 50s or beyond.","The outlook for mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) is variable and depends heavily on the specific syndrome and its severity.  While these syndromes share some common clinical features, the age of onset, rate of progression, and affected organ systems differ significantly.  

As the context provided indicates:

* **Severe forms like Hurler syndrome (MPS I-H)** often lead to a significantly shortened lifespan, with death frequently occurring before age 10 due to complications like airway obstruction, respiratory infections, or cardiac issues.
* **Milder forms like Scheie syndrome (MPS I-S)** allow for survival into adulthood, though with varying degrees of physical and cognitive impairment.
* **Hunter syndrome (MPS II)** has a spectrum of severity.  Mild cases may allow individuals to live into their 50s or beyond, while more severe cases will have a shorter lifespan.

It's important to note that even within a specific MPS type, there can be a range of severity.  Advances in treatment, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for some MPS types, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and supportive care, have improved the outlook for many individuals.  These treatments can slow disease progression, alleviate some symptoms, and improve quality of life.  However, they may not completely eliminate all symptoms or prevent long-term complications.

For a precise prognosis, consultation with a specialist experienced in MPS is essential.  They can provide a more accurate assessment based on the individual's specific diagnosis, symptoms, and response to treatment.


While I cannot provide specific sources for the information given as it was derived from the provided context, further information on specific MPS types and treatments can be found through organizations like the National MPS Society (USA) and the Society for Mucopolysaccharide Diseases (International).",0.7223,0.3536,0.1008,0.1847,10.8688

Do you have information about Bone Grafts,"Summary : A bone graft transplants bone tissue. Surgeons use bone grafts to repair and rebuild diseased bones in your hips, knees, spine, and sometimes other bones and joints. Grafts can also repair bone loss caused by some types of fractures or cancers. Once your body accepts the bone graft, it provides a framework for growth of new, living bone.    If the transplanted bone comes from another person, it is called an allograft. Most allograft bone comes from donors who have died. Tissue banks screen these donors and disinfect and test the donated bone to make sure it is safe to use. If the transplanted bone comes from another part of your own body, it is called an autograft. Autograft bone often comes from your ribs, hips or a leg.","Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone with bone material to repair bone defects or injuries.  The provided context offers a good basic overview. Here's a more detailed explanation of bone grafts:

**Types of Bone Grafts:**

* **Autografts:**  Bone taken from the patient's own body.  Common donor sites include the iliac crest (hip), fibula (lower leg), ribs, and skull. Autografts are considered the ""gold standard"" because they contain the patient's own living bone cells (osteocytes), growth factors, and proteins, minimizing the risk of rejection and maximizing healing potential. However, harvesting autografts requires an additional surgical site, which can increase the risk of pain, infection, and other complications at the donor site.

* **Allografts:** Bone taken from a deceased donor and processed by tissue banks to ensure sterility and safety. Allografts are readily available and avoid the need for a second surgical site. They can provide structural support and sometimes contain growth factors, although these are often processed out.  There is a very small risk of disease transmission, though rigorous screening and sterilization procedures minimize this risk.  Allografts are categorized based on their processing:
    * **Fresh-frozen:** Preserves some of the bone's natural properties.
    * **Freeze-dried:**  More readily available and has a longer shelf life.
    * **Demineralized bone matrix (DBM):** Processed to remove the mineral component, leaving behind a collagen matrix rich in growth factors that can stimulate new bone formation.

* **Xenografts:** Bone derived from another species, typically bovine (cow) or porcine (pig). Xenografts are usually processed to remove all organic material, leaving behind a mineral scaffold that can support new bone growth.

* **Synthetic Bone Grafts:**  These are manufactured materials, such as calcium phosphate ceramics, bioactive glass, and polymers.  They provide a scaffold for new bone growth and can be designed with specific properties to promote bone regeneration.

**Uses of Bone Grafts:**

* **Trauma:** Repairing fractures that have significant bone loss or non-union (failure to heal).
* **Spinal Fusion:**  Promoting bone growth between vertebrae to stabilize the spine.
* **Dental Implants:** Providing a foundation for dental implants.
* **Joint Replacement:** Filling bone defects or voids around joint replacements.
* **Reconstruction after Tumor Resection:**  Replacing bone removed due to cancer surgery.
* **Treatment of Bone Infections (Osteomyelitis):** Filling bone defects after removal of infected tissue.

**Risks and Complications:**

As with any surgical procedure, bone grafting carries some risks, including:

* **Infection:** At either the graft site or the donor site (for autografts).
* **Pain:** At both the graft and donor sites.
* **Nerve damage:**  Possible, especially when harvesting bone from near major nerves.
* **Fracture:** Of the grafted bone or the donor site.
* **Non-union:** The graft may not incorporate with the existing bone.
* **Rejection (allografts):** Although rare, the body may reject the allograft.


**Recovery:**

Recovery time varies depending on the type of graft, the size of the defect, and the patient's overall health.  It can range from several weeks to several months.  Physical therapy is often necessary to regain strength and function.


It's important to consult with a qualified orthopedic surgeon or other specialist to determine the most appropriate type of bone graft and treatment plan for your specific situation.  They can provide personalized information and address any concerns you may have.",0.7059,0.2287,0.0367,0.1159,18.1482
How to diagnose Mixed connective tissue disease ?,How is mixed connective tissue disease diagnosed? Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is often suspected after a physical examination reveals signs and symptoms associated with the condition. The diagnosis is supported by a blood test that shows high levels of antibodies associated with MCTD.,"The diagnosis of Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) is complex and relies on a combination of clinical presentation, serologic findings, and exclusion of other connective tissue diseases.  While the provided context mentions a key serologic marker, it's crucial to understand the full diagnostic process.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **Clinical Presentation:**  A physician will first evaluate the patient's signs and symptoms.  MCTD often presents with features overlapping several connective tissue diseases, including:
    * **Raynaud's phenomenon:**  Cold-induced color changes in the fingers and toes.
    * **Swollen hands (edema):** Puffiness in the hands.
    * **Arthritis:** Joint pain and inflammation.
    * **Myositis:** Muscle inflammation and weakness.
    * **Pulmonary involvement:**  Lung problems like interstitial lung disease.
    * **Esophageal dysmotility:** Difficulty swallowing.
    * **Skin manifestations:**  Rashes, such as those seen in lupus or dermatomyositis.

2. **Serologic Testing:** The hallmark of MCTD is the presence of high titers of anti-U1 ribonucleoprotein (anti-U1 RNP) antibodies.  This is detected through a blood test.  While highly sensitive for MCTD, anti-U1 RNP antibodies can also be present at lower levels in other connective tissue diseases like lupus.  Therefore, the high titer is crucial for MCTD diagnosis.  Other autoantibodies may also be present but are not specific to MCTD.

3. **Exclusion of Other Connective Tissue Diseases:**  It's essential to differentiate MCTD from other overlapping conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  This involves careful evaluation of the clinical features and serologic profile.  For example, while some overlap exists, a patient meeting the full criteria for SLE or SSc would likely receive that diagnosis instead of MCTD.

4. **Diagnostic Criteria:**  Several sets of diagnostic criteria exist for MCTD, including the Alarcon-Segovia criteria and the Kasukawa criteria.  These criteria incorporate various combinations of clinical features and the presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies.  Physicians may use these criteria to aid in diagnosis, but clinical judgment is paramount.

5. **Imaging Studies and Other Investigations:**  Depending on the specific organ involvement, additional tests may be necessary. These can include:
    * **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs):** To assess lung function.
    * **High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest:** To evaluate for interstitial lung disease.
    * **Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies:** To assess for muscle and nerve involvement.
    * **Echocardiogram:** To evaluate for cardiac involvement.

**In summary,** diagnosing MCTD is a multifaceted process requiring a thorough clinical evaluation, serologic testing for anti-U1 RNP antibodies, and exclusion of other connective tissue diseases.  Consulting with a rheumatologist experienced in diagnosing and managing connective tissue diseases is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.


While I can't provide specific medical advice, I hope this information helps you better understand the diagnostic process for MCTD. Please consult with a healthcare professional for any concerns about your health.",0.7639,0.1198,0.0441,0.0918,15.7932
Who is at risk for Prostate Cancer? ?,"Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States. Prostate cancer is found mainly in older men. Although the number of men with prostate cancer is large, most men diagnosed with this disease do not die from it. Prostate cancer causes more deaths in men than any other cancer except lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.","Several factors increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. While some are modifiable, others are not.  Here's a breakdown:

**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**

* **Age:**  The risk of prostate cancer increases significantly with age. Most cases are diagnosed in men over 50, and the risk continues to rise with advancing age.  
* **Race/Ethnicity:** African American men have a higher incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer compared to men of other races, including Caucasian men.  The reasons for this disparity are complex and likely involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors.
* **Family History:**  Having a father or brother with prostate cancer increases a man's risk, especially if they were diagnosed at a younger age.  Having multiple affected family members further increases the risk.  This suggests a genetic component to prostate cancer susceptibility.
* **Inherited Genetic Changes:** Certain inherited gene mutations, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 (also linked to breast and ovarian cancers), increase the risk of prostate cancer, often leading to more aggressive forms of the disease.  HOXB13 is another gene linked to increased risk.

**Potentially Modifiable Risk Factors (further research is ongoing):**

* **Diet:**  Diets high in red meat, processed meat, and high-fat dairy products have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in some studies. However, more research is needed to confirm these associations and understand the underlying mechanisms.
* **Obesity:** Some studies suggest that obesity may be associated with an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer and death from the disease.
* **Smoking:**  Smoking may increase the risk of death from prostate cancer, although its role in the development of the disease is less clear.
* **Chemical Exposure:**  Exposure to certain chemicals, such as Agent Orange (used during the Vietnam War), may increase risk.


**Important Note:** Having one or more risk factors does not guarantee that a man will develop prostate cancer.  Conversely, men without any known risk factors can still develop the disease.  It's crucial for men to discuss their individual risk factors with their doctor and determine the appropriate screening strategy.

What are the symptoms of Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Developmental regression 90% EEG abnormality 90% Reduced consciousness/confusion 90% Seizures 90% Abnormality of temperature regulation 50% Behavioral abnormality 50% Migraine 50% Myalgia 50% Sinusitis 50% Autoimmunity 7.5% Sudden cardiac death 7.5% The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is characterized by the following signs and symptoms, with approximate frequencies based on the provided data from the Human Phenotype Ontology:

* **Highly Frequent (90%):**
    * **Developmental Regression:**  Loss of previously acquired developmental milestones, such as speech, motor skills, or cognitive abilities.
    * **EEG Abnormality:**  Abnormal patterns in the electroencephalogram, indicating disrupted brain activity.
    * **Reduced Consciousness/Confusion:** Altered mental state, ranging from mild disorientation to deep coma.
    * **Seizures:**  Uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain, manifesting as convulsions, staring spells, or other involuntary movements.

* **Moderately Frequent (50%):**
    * **Abnormality of Temperature Regulation:** Difficulty maintaining a normal body temperature, often presenting as persistent fever.
    * **Behavioral Abnormality:** Changes in behavior, such as irritability, aggression, or withdrawal.
    * **Migraine:** Severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound.  It's important to note that the association of migraine with FIRES may warrant further investigation as it's not a commonly reported symptom.
    * **Myalgia:** Muscle aches and pains.
    * **Sinusitis:** Inflammation of the sinuses.  Similar to migraine, the connection between sinusitis and FIRES may be coincidental or require more research.

* **Less Frequent (7.5%):**
    * **Autoimmunity:**  A condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues.  The presence of autoimmunity in this context suggests a possible role of immune dysregulation in FIRES, but further research is needed.
    * **Sudden Cardiac Death:**  Unexpected death due to a sudden cardiac event.  This serious complication highlights the potential systemic effects of FIRES.


It is crucial to understand that these frequencies are estimates based on limited studies and may not represent the full spectrum of FIRES manifestations.  The presentation can vary significantly between individuals.  Furthermore, some symptoms like migraine and sinusitis might be coincidental rather than directly related to FIRES.  Diagnosis requires a thorough evaluation by a medical professional, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, EEG, and other relevant tests.",0.8285,0.3916,0.0947,0.2098,12.7656
What are the genetic changes related to Weaver syndrome ?,"Weaver syndrome is usually caused by mutations in the EZH2 gene. The EZH2 gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases modify proteins called histones, which are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (methylation), histone methyltransferases can turn off the activity of certain genes, which is an essential process in normal development. It is unclear how mutations in the EZH2 gene result in the abnormalities characteristic of Weaver syndrome.","Weaver syndrome is primarily associated with heterozygous *de novo* (new) mutations in the *EZH2* gene, located on chromosome 7q36.  These mutations typically result in an overactivation (gain-of-function) of the EZH2 protein, a histone methyltransferase.  While EZH2 normally functions by adding methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), leading to gene repression, the mutations found in Weaver syndrome enhance this activity.

The specific genetic changes observed in Weaver syndrome include:

* **Missense mutations:** These mutations substitute a single amino acid in the EZH2 protein.  Many of these mutations cluster in the SET domain, a crucial region for the enzyme's catalytic activity.  These mutations are thought to increase the enzymatic activity of EZH2, leading to excessive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).
* **Other less common mutations:** Although less frequent, other types of mutations, such as deletions or duplications involving *EZH2*, have also been reported in some individuals with Weaver syndrome.


It's important to note that the exact mechanism by which increased H3K27me3 caused by *EZH2* mutations leads to the specific features of Weaver syndrome (overgrowth, advanced bone age, intellectual disability, characteristic facial features) remains incompletely understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the downstream effects of these epigenetic changes and their impact on developmental pathways.

What are the genetic changes related to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ?,"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus may be caused by mutations in several genes.  About 30 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the KCNJ11 gene. An additional 20 percent of people with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus have mutations in the ABCC8 gene. These genes provide instructions for making parts (subunits) of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel. Each K-ATP channel consists of eight subunits, four produced from the KCNJ11 gene and four from the ABCC8 gene.  K-ATP channels are found across cell membranes in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. These channels open and close in response to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. Closure of the channels in response to increased glucose triggers the release of insulin out of beta cells and into the bloodstream, which helps control blood sugar levels.  Mutations in the KCNJ11 or ABCC8 gene that cause permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus result in K-ATP channels that do not close, leading to reduced insulin secretion from beta cells and impaired blood sugar control.  Mutations in the INS gene, which provides instructions for making insulin, have been identified in about 20 percent of individuals with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Insulin is produced in a precursor form called proinsulin, which consists of a single chain of protein building blocks (amino acids). The proinsulin chain is cut (cleaved) to form individual pieces called the A and B chains, which are joined together by connections called disulfide bonds to form insulin. Mutations in the INS gene are believed to disrupt the cleavage of the proinsulin chain or the binding of the A and B chains to form insulin, leading to impaired blood sugar control.  Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus can also be caused by mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified.","Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) is associated with genetic changes in several genes, primarily affecting insulin production or secretion.  The most common genetic causes include:

* **KCNJ11:** Mutations in this gene account for approximately 30% of PNDM cases.  KCNJ11 encodes a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel in pancreatic beta cells. These mutations disrupt channel function, preventing closure in response to glucose and thus impairing insulin secretion.

* **ABCC8:**  Also involved in K-ATP channel formation, mutations in ABCC8 contribute to about 20% of PNDM cases. Similar to KCNJ11 mutations, these also disrupt channel function and insulin release.

* **INS:**  Mutations in the INS gene, responsible for insulin production, are found in roughly 20% of individuals with PNDM. These mutations can interfere with the processing of proinsulin into mature insulin, leading to reduced insulin availability.

* **Other Genes:** While the above three genes represent the majority of known genetic causes, PNDM can also result from mutations in other, less frequently identified genes. Research continues to explore these additional genetic contributors.


The provided context gives a good overview of the genetic landscape of PNDM.  It's important to remember that these percentages are estimates and can vary across populations.",0.72,0.452,0.1526,0.252,9.4081
What are the treatments for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"How might glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency be treated? The most important aspect of management for G6PD deficiency is to avoid agents that might trigger an attack. In cases of acute hemolytic anemia, a blood transfusion or even an exchange transfusion may be required. The G6PD Deficiency Association, which is an advocacy group that provides information and supportive resources to individuals and families affected by G6PD deficiency, provides a list of drugs and food ingredients that individuals with this condition should avoid. They also maintain a list of low risk drugs that are generally safe to take in low doses.","The primary ""treatment"" for G6PD deficiency focuses on preventing hemolytic crises by avoiding triggers.  There is no cure or specific medication to correct the enzyme deficiency itself. Management strategies include:

1. **Trigger Avoidance:** This is the cornerstone of G6PD deficiency management.  Patients must meticulously avoid known triggers, which can include:

    * **Certain Medications:**  A wide range of drugs can trigger hemolysis, including some antibiotics (sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin), antimalarials (primaquine, chloroquine), and analgesics (aspirin in high doses).  The G6PD Deficiency Association provides detailed lists of drugs to avoid and those considered safe.  Always consult with a physician or pharmacist before taking any new medication.
    * **Certain Foods:** Fava beans (broad beans) are a well-known trigger and should be strictly avoided.  Some other foods may also pose a risk, though evidence is less definitive.
    * **Infections:**  Illnesses, even seemingly minor ones, can precipitate hemolysis.  Prompt treatment of infections is crucial.
    * **Stress:**  Severe physical or emotional stress can also be a trigger.

2. **Management of Acute Hemolytic Anemia:** If a hemolytic crisis occurs, supportive care is essential and may include:

    * **Blood Transfusion:**  In severe cases, transfusions of red blood cells may be necessary to replace those destroyed during hemolysis.
    * **Exchange Transfusion:** In rare instances, particularly in newborns with severe hemolysis, an exchange transfusion (removing and replacing the patient's blood) may be required to rapidly remove damaged red blood cells and circulating triggers.
    * **Intravenous Fluids:**  Maintaining hydration is important.
    * **Oxygen Therapy:**  Supplemental oxygen may be necessary if oxygen levels are low.
    * **Close Monitoring:** Careful observation of hemoglobin levels, reticulocyte count, and other blood parameters is crucial to track the severity and resolution of the hemolytic episode.

3. **Patient Education and Support:**  Connecting patients and their families with resources like the G6PD Deficiency Association is invaluable.  Education about the condition, trigger avoidance, and emergency management empowers individuals to effectively manage their condition and minimize the risk of complications.


It's important to note that the severity of G6PD deficiency and the likelihood of experiencing hemolysis vary widely.  Individualized management plans are essential and should be developed in consultation with a hematologist or other qualified healthcare professional.",0.7176,0.3067,0.0759,0.1644,12.6304

While the provided list highlights some key features, it lacks specific frequency data.  Based on the general understanding of DI-CMTC and related CMT subtypes, the following symptoms are typically observed:

* **Distal muscle weakness:** This is a hallmark of CMT and is often the presenting symptom.  It usually begins in the feet and ankles, leading to foot drop, gait instability, and difficulty walking.  Later, it can progress to the hands and forearms, causing difficulty with fine motor tasks.
* **Distal amyotrophy:**  This refers to the wasting away of muscles in the distal extremities due to nerve damage.  It often accompanies muscle weakness and contributes to the characteristic ""stork leg"" or ""inverted champagne bottle"" appearance of the lower legs seen in some CMT patients.
* **Distal sensory impairment:**  Reduced sensation in the feet and hands is common, manifesting as numbness, tingling, or pain.  This can lead to difficulties with balance and coordination and increase the risk of injuries.
* **Abnormality of the foot:** This can include high arches (pes cavus), hammertoes, and other foot deformities.  These are often secondary to the muscle weakness and imbalance caused by the underlying nerve damage.
* **Upper limb muscle weakness:** While typically less severe than in the lower limbs, weakness in the hands and forearms can occur, affecting dexterity and grip strength.

**Important Considerations:**

* **""Axonal regeneration""** is a biological process, not a symptom.  While attempts at axonal regeneration occur in CMT, they are often ineffective.
* **""Autosomal dominant inheritance""** is a mode of genetic transmission, not a symptom.  It indicates how the disease is passed down through families.

**Need for Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation:**  It's crucial to remember that the severity and specific combination of symptoms can vary significantly between individuals with DI-CMTC.  A thorough neurological examination, including nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG), is essential for accurate diagnosis and assessment of disease progression.  Genetic testing is also necessary to confirm the specific CMT subtype.

Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of retinal pigmentation 90% Optic atrophy 50% Abnormal electroretinogram 7.5% Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lens 7.5% Dyschromatopsia 7.5% Microphthalmia 7.5% Abnormality of chorioretinal pigmentation - Abnormality of color vision - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Glaucoma - Microcornea - Nyctalopia - Nystagmus - Pigmentary retinopathy - Pulverulent Cataract - Retinal arteriolar constriction - Retinal arteriolar occlusion - Retinal detachment - Strabismus - Vitreous hemorrhage - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Vitreoretinochoroidopathy (VRCP), also known as Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy, dominant type, primarily affects the eye.  The symptoms listed, along with their approximate frequencies based on the provided data, are:

* **Abnormality of retinal pigmentation (90%):** This is the most common symptom and refers to unusual changes in the color and pattern of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This can manifest as clumping or spreading of pigment.

* **Optic atrophy (50%):**  Damage to the optic nerve, which transmits visual information from the retina to the brain. This can lead to vision loss.

* **Abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) (7.5%):** An ERG measures the electrical activity of the retina. An abnormal result indicates dysfunction in the retinal cells.

* **Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the lens (7.5%):**  Underdevelopment (hypoplasia) or absence (aplasia) of the lens, which focuses light onto the retina. This can cause blurry vision.

* **Dyschromatopsia (7.5%):**  Difficulty distinguishing colors, often referred to as color blindness.

* **Microphthalmia (7.5%):**  Abnormally small eyes.

* **Abnormality of chorioretinal pigmentation:**  Similar to abnormality of retinal pigmentation, but specifically involving the choroid, a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue beneath the retina.

* **Abnormality of color vision:**  A broader term encompassing various difficulties with color perception, including dyschromatopsia.

* **Glaucoma:** Increased pressure within the eye, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.

* **Microcornea:**  Abnormally small cornea, the clear front part of the eye.

* **Nyctalopia:**  Difficulty seeing in low light conditions, often called ""night blindness.""

* **Nystagmus:**  Involuntary, repetitive eye movements that can cause blurred vision.

* **Pigmentary retinopathy:**  A group of disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the retina, often leading to vision loss.

* **Pulverulent Cataract:**  A type of cataract where small, dust-like opacities form in the lens.

* **Retinal arteriolar constriction:** Narrowing of the small arteries in the retina, which can restrict blood flow.

* **Retinal arteriolar occlusion:** Blockage of the small arteries in the retina, which can cause sudden vision loss.

* **Retinal detachment:** Separation of the retina from the underlying tissue, a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention.

* **Strabismus:**  Misalignment of the eyes, commonly known as crossed eyes or wall-eyed.

* **Vitreous hemorrhage:** Bleeding into the vitreous, the gel-like substance that fills the eye. This can cause blurry vision or floaters.

It's important to note that these percentages are estimates and may vary between studies.  Also, not all individuals with VRCP will experience all of these symptoms.  The severity and combination of symptoms can vary widely.  If you suspect you or someone you know may have VRCP, it is crucial to consult with an ophthalmologist or other qualified medical professional for a proper diagnosis and management.",0.7429,0.4106,0.1064,0.2207,15.3049
How many people are affected by Heart Attack ?,"Very common. Each year, more than 1 million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. About one-half of those who die do so within 1 hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital.","Based on the provided context, more than **one million** people in the U.S. are affected by heart attacks each year.  It also states that roughly half of those who experience a heart attack die from it, with about half of those deaths occurring within the first hour of symptom onset.",0.695,0.5625,0.3191,0.3958,3.6058
What is (are) Rett Syndrome ?,"Rett syndrome is a progressive, neuro-developmental condition that primarily affects girls. Affected girls appear to have normal psychomotor development during the first 6 to 18 months of life, followed by a developmental ""plateau,"" and then rapid regression in language and motor skills. Additional signs and symptoms may include repetitive, stereotypic hand movements; fits of screaming and inconsolable crying; autistic features; panic-like attacks; teeth grinding (bruxism); episodic apnea and/or hyperpnea; gait ataxia and apraxia; tremors; seizures; and slowed head growth. Some people have an atypical form of Rett syndrome that may be more mild or more severe. Classic Rett syndrome is most commonly caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and is usually inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. The vast majority of cases are not inherited from a parent, but are due to a new mutation in the affected person. Treatment mainly focuses on the specific signs and symptoms of the condition.","Rett Syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder that almost exclusively affects females.  It is characterized by normal early development followed by a period of regression, losing previously acquired skills like speech and purposeful hand use.  

Here's a breakdown of key features:

* **Onset:**  Symptoms typically emerge after 6-18 months of seemingly normal development.  This period of normal development is a hallmark of the condition.
* **Regression:**  The regressive phase involves a loss of acquired skills, including:
    * **Language:**  Significant language regression is a prominent feature.
    * **Motor Skills:**  Purposeful hand movements are replaced by characteristic repetitive, stereotypic hand movements (e.g., hand-wringing, clapping, tapping, mouthing).  Gait abnormalities (ataxia, apraxia) are also common.
* **Additional Symptoms:**  A wide range of other symptoms can occur, including:
    * **Behavioral Issues:**  Autistic-like features, anxiety, panic-like attacks, irritability, and inconsolable crying.
    * **Breathing Problems:**  Episodic apnea (breath-holding) and/or hyperpnea (rapid breathing).
    * **Other Neurological Manifestations:**  Seizures, tremors, bruxism (teeth grinding), and slowed head growth (microcephaly).
* **Atypical Rett Syndrome:** Variations exist with milder or more severe presentations, sometimes involving different genetic mutations.
* **Genetics:**  Classic Rett Syndrome is primarily caused by mutations in the *MECP2* gene located on the X chromosome.  It is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner.  Because females have two X chromosomes, the presence of one mutated copy usually results in the syndrome.  Males with a *MECP2* mutation often experience a more severe, early-onset encephalopathy and typically do not survive infancy.  The vast majority of Rett Syndrome cases arise from *de novo* (new) mutations in the affected individual, not inherited from a parent.
* **Treatment:**  Currently, there is no cure for Rett Syndrome.  Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care, such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medications to control seizures and other specific symptoms.

**Sources:**

While no specific source was provided in the context, information on Rett Syndrome is readily available from reputable organizations like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Rett Syndrome Research Trust (RSRT).  This response aligns with information typically provided by these organizations.",0.7658,0.4748,0.2222,0.3179,13.6558
How to diagnose Salivary Gland Cancer ?,"Tests that examine the head, neck, and the inside of the mouth are used to detect (find) and diagnose salivary gland cancer. The following procedures may be used:         -  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health. The head, neck, mouth, and throat will be checked for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. For salivary gland cancer, an endoscope is inserted into the mouth to look at the mouth, throat, and larynx. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.               -  Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. An FNA is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue that doesnt look normal.      -  Surgery : If cancer cannot be diagnosed from the sample of tissue removed during an FNA biopsy or an incisional biopsy, the mass may be removed and checked for signs of cancer.                 Because salivary gland cancer can be hard to diagnose, patients should ask to have the tissue samples checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing salivary gland cancer.","Diagnosing salivary gland cancer involves a combination of physical examination and imaging tests, culminating in a biopsy for definitive diagnosis.  Because these cancers can be challenging to diagnose accurately, it's crucial to have experienced specialists involved. Here's a breakdown of the diagnostic process:

**1. Physical Examination and History:**  A thorough examination of the head, neck, mouth, and throat is performed to assess for any lumps, swelling, pain, or other abnormalities. The patient's medical history, including past illnesses, habits (like tobacco use), and any relevant symptoms, is also reviewed.

**2. Imaging Studies:**  These tests help visualize the salivary glands and assess the extent of any abnormalities.

* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**  Provides detailed images of soft tissues, helping to define the size and location of the tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures.
* **CT Scan (Computed Tomography):**  Offers detailed cross-sectional images, useful for evaluating the tumor's spread to nearby lymph nodes or other tissues.  Contrast dye may be used to enhance the images.
* **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography):**  While not routinely used for initial diagnosis, a PET scan can help determine if a tumor is metabolically active, suggesting malignancy. It can also be helpful in staging the cancer and assessing for distant metastasis.
* **Endoscopy:** In some cases, endoscopy may be used to visualize the inside of the mouth, throat, and larynx to assess for any primary or secondary lesions.

**3. Biopsy:**  This is the most crucial step in diagnosing salivary gland cancer.  A sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope by a pathologist.

* **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) Biopsy:**  The most common biopsy method, involving a thin needle to extract cells or fluid from the suspicious area. It's minimally invasive but may not always provide enough tissue for a definitive diagnosis.
* **Incisional Biopsy:**  A small portion of the abnormal tissue is surgically removed. This provides more tissue for analysis than FNA but is slightly more invasive.
* **Excisional Biopsy/Surgery:**  If previous biopsies are inconclusive, the entire mass or the affected salivary gland may be surgically removed.  This allows for a complete pathological examination.

**Importance of Pathologist Expertise:**  Salivary gland cancers are relatively rare and can have diverse histological subtypes. It's essential that the biopsy samples are reviewed by a pathologist experienced in diagnosing salivary gland tumors to ensure accurate classification and guide treatment decisions.


**In summary:** The diagnostic journey for salivary gland cancer begins with a clinical examination and imaging, but a biopsy is essential for confirmation.  Seeking evaluation by experienced head and neck specialists and pathologists is crucial for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",0.873,0.5086,0.1791,0.2566,14.7634
Is Hereditary lymphedema type II inherited ?,"How is hereditary lymphedema type II inherited? Hereditary lymphedema type II appears to have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, which means that one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. People with hereditary lymphedema type II usually have at least one other affected family member, in most cases, a parent. When the condition occurs in only one person in a family, the condition is described as Meige-like lymphedema.","Yes, Hereditary lymphedema type II (also known as Meige disease) is inherited.  It follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means only one copy of the mutated gene is necessary to cause the condition.  Therefore, if a parent has the altered gene, there is a 50% chance they will pass it on to each of their children.

While most individuals with Hereditary lymphedema type II have affected family members, there are cases where it appears to occur spontaneously with no prior family history.  This situation is often referred to as ""Meige-like lymphedema.""  It's important to note that even in these seemingly spontaneous cases, there may be an underlying genetic cause, such as a new mutation in the affected individual.",0.8596,0.5253,0.2245,0.3333,6.2373
Do you have information about Food Labeling,"Summary : Most packaged foods in the U.S. have food labels. On every food label you will see       - Serving size, number of servings, and number of calories per serving     - Information on the amount of dietary fat, cholesterol, dietary fiber, dietary sodium, carbohydrates, dietary proteins, vitamins, and minerals in each serving     -  Definitions for terms such as low-fat and high-fiber     - Information to help you see how a food fits into an overall daily diet        Food and Drug Administration","Yes, I have information about food labeling, particularly in the United States, as regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Some lose weight without trying. Additional signs include sores that heal slowly, dry, itchy skin, loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight. Some people with diabetes, however, have no symptoms at all.","The symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type (Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational) and the individual. Some people may experience no noticeable symptoms at all, especially in the early stages of Type 2 diabetes.  However, common symptoms include:

* **Frequent Urination (Polyuria):**  The body tries to get rid of excess glucose through urine.
* **Excessive Thirst (Polydipsia):**  Increased urination leads to dehydration and increased thirst.
* **Unexplained Weight Loss:** The body isn't able to use glucose effectively for energy, leading to weight loss.
* **Increased Hunger (Polyphagia):**  Cells are starved of glucose, triggering hunger signals.
* **Blurry Vision:**  High blood sugar can affect the lens and fluid in the eye.
* **Slow-Healing Sores:** High blood sugar impairs circulation and the immune system, hindering wound healing.
* **Frequent Infections:**  High blood sugar weakens the immune system.
* **Numbness or Tingling in the Hands or Feet (Neuropathy):**  High blood sugar can damage nerves.
* **Fatigue:**  The body's inability to use glucose efficiently for energy leads to fatigue.
* **Dry, Itchy Skin:**  Dehydration and poor circulation can contribute to dry, itchy skin.


It is crucial to note that these symptoms are not exclusive to diabetes and can be indicative of other conditions.  **If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management.** They can perform blood tests to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.

How is asthma diagnosed?,"Your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories, a physical exam, and test results.
                
Your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthmathat is, whether it's intermittent, mild, moderate, or severe. The level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on.
                
You may need to see an asthma specialist if:
                
You need special tests to help diagnose asthma
                
You've had a life-threatening asthma attack
                
You need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma, or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled
                
You're thinking about getting allergy treatments
                
Medical and Family Histories
                
Your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies. He or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur.
                
Let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places, or if they get worse at night.
                
Your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them. For more information about possible asthma triggers, go to ""What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Asthma?""
                
Your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management. These conditions include a runny nose, sinus infections, reflux disease, psychological stress, and sleep apnea.
                
Physical Exam
                
Your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies. These signs include wheezing, a runny nose or swollen nasal passages, and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema).
                
Keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you.
                
Diagnostic Tests
                
Lung Function Test
                
Your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-ROM-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working. This test measures how much air you can breathe in and out. It also measures how fast you can blow air out.
                
Your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved.
                
If the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine, and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms, your diagnosis will likely be asthma.
                
Other Tests
                
Your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis. Other tests may include:
                
Allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you, if any.
                
A test to measure how sensitive your airways are. This is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-KO-prav-eh-KA-shun) test. Using spirometry, this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in.
                
A test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma, such as reflux disease, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea.
                
A chest x ray or an EKG (electrocardiogram). These tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms.
                
Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children
                
Most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age. However, asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose.
                
Sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition. This is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions.
                
Also, many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old.
                
A child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections. The airways grow as the child grows older, so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds.
                
A young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if:
                
One or both parents have asthma
                
The child has signs of allergies, including the allergic skin condition eczema
                
The child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens
                
The child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection
                
The most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test, a medical history, and a physical exam. However, it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years. Thus, doctors must rely on children's medical histories, signs and symptoms, and physical exams to make a diagnosis.
                
Doctors also may use a 46 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds.","Asthma diagnosis involves a combination of medical history review, physical examination, and lung function tests.  For young children, where lung function tests can be difficult, diagnosis relies more heavily on medical history, observation of symptoms, and sometimes a trial of asthma medications.

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Medical and Family History:**

* The doctor will inquire about the patient's personal and family history of asthma and allergies.
* Questions will cover the frequency, timing, and triggers of asthma symptoms (e.g., seasonal variations, specific locations, nighttime worsening).
* The doctor will also ask about other health conditions that could complicate asthma management, such as rhinitis, sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), stress, and sleep apnea.

**2. Physical Exam:**

* The doctor will listen to the patient's lungs for wheezing and other abnormal breath sounds.
* They will examine the nose and throat for signs of inflammation or swelling.
* Skin will be checked for signs of allergic conditions like eczema.
* The absence of these signs during the examination doesn't rule out asthma.

**3. Diagnostic Tests:**

* **Spirometry (Lung Function Test):** This is the primary test for diagnosing asthma in individuals old enough to perform it (generally age 5 and up).  It measures the amount and speed of airflow in and out of the lungs.  The test may be repeated after administering a bronchodilator to see if lung function improves, which supports an asthma diagnosis.
* **Other Tests (if needed):**
    * **Allergy Testing:** To identify specific allergens triggering asthma symptoms.
    * **Bronchoprovocation Test:** To assess airway hyperresponsiveness by measuring lung function during exercise or after exposure to cold air or specific chemicals.
    * **Tests for other conditions:**  To rule out conditions that mimic asthma, such as GERD, vocal cord dysfunction, or sleep apnea. This might include imaging studies (chest x-ray) or an electrocardiogram (EKG).

**4. Diagnosing Asthma in Young Children (Under 5):**

* Diagnosis is more challenging in this age group due to the difficulty of performing spirometry.
* Doctors rely on:
    * Parental reports of symptoms.
    * Family history of asthma and allergies.
    * Presence of other allergic conditions like eczema.
    * Wheezing episodes, especially those unrelated to colds.
* A trial of asthma medication for 4-6 weeks may be used to see if the child responds.

How many people are affected by Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ?,"SJS/TEN is a rare disease, affecting 1 to 2 per million people each year. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (the less severe form of the condition) is more common than toxic epidermal necrolysis.  People who are HIV-positive and those with a chronic inflammatory disease called systemic lupus erythematosus are more likely to develop SJS/TEN than the general population. The reason for the increased risk is unclear, but immune system factors and exposure to multiple medications may play a role.","Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are considered a spectrum of the same disease, with SJS being the less severe form and TEN the more severe.  The combined incidence of SJS/TEN is estimated at 1 to 2 cases per million people per year.  Given the global population of roughly 8 billion, this translates to approximately 8,000 to 16,000 new cases of SJS/TEN worldwide annually.

Analgesics, low doses of antidepressants, and some anticonvulsant medications may be prescribed for relief of pain, burning, or tingling. Some individuals find that walking regularly, taking warm baths, or using elastic stockings may help relieve leg pain.","The provided context gives a good overview of diabetic neuropathy treatment.  Let's expand on that and provide a more structured approach:

**Treatment for Diabetic Neuropathy focuses on two main goals:**

1. **Controlling Blood Glucose Levels:** This is the cornerstone of managing diabetic neuropathy and preventing further nerve damage.  Tight glycemic control can slow progression and, in some cases, even improve symptoms.  This is achieved through:

    * **Lifestyle Modifications:**  Diet, exercise, and weight management are crucial.  A registered dietitian can help create a personalized meal plan.
    * **Medications:**  Various medications, including insulin and other anti-diabetic drugs, are used to manage blood sugar levels as prescribed by a physician.

2. **Symptom Management:**  Several approaches are used to alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with diabetic neuropathy:

    * **First-Line Pain Medications:**
        * **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs):**  Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and imipramine are examples. These medications can relieve burning, tingling, and stabbing pain. (Attal et al., 2010).
        * **Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs):** Duloxetine and venlafaxine are commonly used.  They can help with pain, sleep, and mood. (Finnerup et al., 2015).
        * **Gabapentinoids:** Pregabalin and gabapentin are anticonvulsants also effective for nerve pain. (Moore et al., 2014).

    * **Other Medications (often used if first-line treatments are insufficient):**
        * **Opioids:**  These are typically reserved for severe cases due to the risk of dependence and side effects.
        * **Topical treatments:** Capsaicin cream and lidocaine patches can provide localized pain relief.

    * **Non-Pharmacological Approaches:**
        * **Foot Care:**  Essential to prevent ulcers and infections due to decreased sensation.  This includes daily inspection, proper footwear, and regular podiatrist visits.
        * **Physical Therapy:**  Can improve strength, balance, and range of motion.
        * **Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS):**  May offer some pain relief.
        * **Complementary therapies:**  Acupuncture, biofeedback, and meditation may be helpful for some individuals but require further research to establish efficacy.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Early Diagnosis and Treatment:**  Early intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible nerve damage.
* **Individualized Treatment Plans:**  Treatment approaches should be tailored to the individual's specific symptoms and needs.
* **Regular Monitoring:**  Ongoing monitoring of blood glucose levels and neuropathy symptoms is essential to adjust treatment as needed.
* **Multidisciplinary Approach:**  Managing diabetic neuropathy often involves a team of healthcare professionals, including a primary care physician, endocrinologist, neurologist, podiatrist, and pain specialist.

How many people are affected by hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome ?,"Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome has been estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 individuals.","Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome is a rare genetic disorder.  The provided context stating an estimated prevalence of 1 in 200,000 individuals is generally accepted.  This means that for every 200,000 people in a given population, approximately one individual is expected to have this syndrome.  It's important to note that this is an estimate, and the actual number of affected individuals may vary slightly depending on the population studied.",0.8032,0.2619,0.1463,0.2143,3.7473
What are the genetic changes related to Huntington disease-like syndrome ?,"In about one percent of people with the characteristic features of Huntington disease, no mutation in the HD gene has been identified. Mutations in the PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes have been found to cause the signs and symptoms in some of these individuals. HDL1 is caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, while HDL2 results from mutations in JPH3. Mutations in the TBP gene are responsible for HDL4 (also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 17). The genetic cause of HDL3 is unknown.  The PRNP, JPH3, and TBP genes provide instructions for making proteins that are important for normal brain function. The features of HDL syndromes result from a particular type of mutation in any one of these genes. This mutation increases the length of a repeated segment of DNA within the gene, which leads to the production of an abnormal PRNP, JPH3, or TBP protein. The abnormal protein can build up in nerve cells (neurons) and disrupt the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL syndromes.  Other medical conditions and gene mutations may also cause signs and symptoms resembling Huntington disease. In some affected people, the cause of the disorder is never identified.","Huntington disease-like (HDL) syndromes share clinical features with Huntington disease but are not caused by a mutation in the *HTT* gene (which causes Huntington disease).  Instead, specific genetic changes in other genes are responsible for some of these syndromes:

* **HDL1:** Mutations in the *PRNP* gene.
* **HDL2:** Mutations in the *JPH3* gene.
* **HDL4 (also known as Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 17):** Mutations in the *TBP* gene.
* **HDL3:** The genetic cause remains unknown.

The common mechanism in HDL1, HDL2, and HDL4 involves an expansion of a repeated DNA segment within the respective gene. This expansion leads to the production of an abnormal protein (PRNP, JPH3, or TBP) that accumulates in neurons, disrupting their function and eventually causing neuronal death.  This neuronal dysfunction underlies the characteristic signs and symptoms of these HDL syndromes.

It's important to note that not all cases with Huntington disease-like symptoms have an identified genetic cause. Other medical conditions and genetic mutations can mimic Huntington disease, and in some individuals, the underlying cause remains unknown.",0.7549,0.5947,0.2857,0.4053,7.2582
What are the treatments for Mucopolysaccharidosis type I ?,"What treatment is available for mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I)? The two main treatments for MPS I are enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and bone marrow transplant. Both of these treatments work by replacing the missing IDUA enzyme. A drug called laronidase or Aldurazyme is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, this treatment is not expected to treat problems with mental development because laronidase cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. A bone marrow transplant is another treatment option that provides the person with MPS I with cells that can produce the IDUA enyzme. A bone marrow transplant can stop the progression of neurological problems.","Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), also known as Hurler syndrome, Scheie syndrome, and Hurler-Scheie syndrome, is primarily treated with two main approaches:

1. **Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT):**  ERT involves regular intravenous infusions of a recombinant human α-L-iduronidase enzyme called laronidase (Aldurazyme®).  This enzyme replaces the deficient enzyme in patients with MPS I, leading to improvements in various physical symptoms.  ERT can improve:

    * **Respiratory function:**  By reducing airway obstruction and improving lung capacity.
    * **Growth:** By promoting more normal growth patterns.
    * **Skeletal and joint health:** By reducing joint stiffness and pain, and improving bone structure.
    * **Cardiac function:** By reducing heart valve thickening and improving heart function.

    **Limitations of ERT:**  ERT is not effective in treating the neurological manifestations of MPS I because the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.

2. **Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT):**  Also known as bone marrow transplantation, HSCT involves replacing the patient's bone marrow with healthy donor marrow. The donor marrow cells produce the missing α-L-iduronidase enzyme, which can then be distributed throughout the body, including the central nervous system. HSCT can:

    * **Slow or halt the progression of neurological decline:** This is a key advantage of HSCT over ERT.
    * **Improve other systemic manifestations:**  Similar to ERT, HSCT can improve physical symptoms related to the respiratory, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems.

    **Limitations of HSCT:** HSCT is a more invasive procedure than ERT and carries risks associated with transplantation, such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infection, and rejection.  The success of HSCT depends on factors such as the availability of a suitable donor, the patient's overall health, and the timing of the transplant (earlier transplantation is generally associated with better outcomes, especially for neurological involvement).


**Other Supportive Treatments:**  In addition to ERT and HSCT, individuals with MPS I may require various supportive treatments to manage specific symptoms and complications, including:

* **Physical therapy:** To maintain joint mobility and function.
* **Respiratory therapy:** To manage airway obstruction and improve lung function.
* **Surgical interventions:**  For example, to address carpal tunnel syndrome, hernias, or spinal cord compression.
* **Hearing and vision care:** To manage hearing loss and vision problems.


It is important to note that the optimal treatment approach for MPS I is determined on an individual basis, taking into account the patient's age, disease severity, overall health, and the availability of a suitable donor for HSCT.  Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for maximizing treatment effectiveness and improving long-term outcomes.  Genetic counseling is also recommended for families affected by MPS I.",0.6763,0.3233,0.1094,0.1729,13.5361
What to do for Adrenal Insufficiency and Addison's Disease ?,"Some people with Addisons disease who are aldosterone deficient can benefit from following a diet rich in sodium. A health care provider or a dietitian can give specific recommendations on appropriate sodium sources and daily sodium guidelines if necessary.
                
Corticosteroid treatment is linked to an increased risk of osteoporosisa condition in which the bones become less dense and more likely to fracture. People who take corticosteroids should protect their bone health by consuming enough dietary calcium and vitamin D. A health care provider or a dietitian can give specific recommendations on appropriate daily calcium intake based upon age and suggest the best types of calcium supplements, if necessary.","Adrenal insufficiency, including Addison's disease, requires lifelong management focused on replacing the missing hormones (cortisol and often aldosterone) and addressing potential complications. Here's a breakdown of what to do:

**1. Hormone Replacement Therapy:**

* **Glucocorticoids (e.g., hydrocortisone, prednisone, dexamethasone):** These replace cortisol, the hormone that helps the body respond to stress and regulate metabolism.  The dose is individualized and needs careful titration by an endocrinologist.  It's crucial to take these medications exactly as prescribed.
* **Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone):**  This replaces aldosterone, which regulates salt and water balance.  Not everyone with Addison's requires this, particularly if their aldosterone levels are sufficient.  An endocrinologist will determine the need and appropriate dosage.

**2. Lifestyle Modifications:**

* **Diet:**
    * **Sodium Intake:** As the prompt mentions, individuals with aldosterone deficiency may need a higher sodium intake.  However, this should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and under the guidance of a healthcare professional or registered dietitian.  Too much sodium can be detrimental to overall health.
    * **Calcium and Vitamin D:** Due to the increased risk of osteoporosis from corticosteroid treatment, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are crucial.  Again, a healthcare professional or registered dietitian can provide personalized recommendations.
* **Medical Alert Identification:**  Wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace is essential.  This informs emergency personnel about the condition and the need for steroid injections in case of severe illness or injury.
* **Emergency Injection Kit:** Patients should have an emergency injection kit containing hydrocortisone and be trained on how to administer it in situations of acute adrenal crisis (severe illness, injury, or surgery).
* **Stress Management:**  Stress can exacerbate adrenal insufficiency symptoms.  Managing stress through techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can be beneficial.
* **Regular Medical Follow-up:** Regular check-ups with an endocrinologist are vital for monitoring hormone levels, adjusting medication dosages, and managing potential complications.

**3. Recognizing and Managing Adrenal Crisis (Addisonian Crisis):**

This is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate medical attention.  Symptoms include:

* Severe weakness
* Sudden, penetrating pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs
* Severe vomiting and diarrhea, leading to dehydration
* Low blood pressure
* Loss of consciousness

**If an adrenal crisis is suspected, administer the emergency hydrocortisone injection immediately and seek emergency medical care.**

**4. Other Considerations:**

* **Vaccinations:** Patients with adrenal insufficiency may require additional vaccinations, especially against pneumococcal disease and influenza.
* **Medication Interactions:** Certain medications can interact with corticosteroids.  Always inform all healthcare providers about your Addison's disease and the medications you are taking.
* **Sick Day Rules:**  During periods of illness (even minor illnesses like a cold), it's crucial to increase hydrocortisone dosage as instructed by your endocrinologist. This helps the body cope with the added stress.

This procedure removes the patient's blood, separates the plasma (which contains the autoantibodies causing the disease), and replaces it with donor plasma or a plasma substitute.  Plasma exchange is typically performed daily or even twice daily until the platelet count recovers and other signs of TTP improve.

Other treatments that may be used in conjunction with plasma exchange include:

* **Immunosuppressants:**  These medications, such as corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), rituximab, or caplacizumab, help to further suppress the immune system and reduce the production of the harmful autoantibodies. Rituximab is particularly useful in preventing relapse. Caplacizumab is a newer medication specifically targeting a protein involved in platelet aggregation in TTP.
* **Splenectomy (surgical removal of the spleen):**  This procedure may be considered in cases that are refractory to plasma exchange and immunosuppressants, though it's less common now with the availability of newer therapies.
* **Platelet transfusions:** Generally *avoided* in TTP unless there is life-threatening bleeding.  Giving platelets can potentially worsen the formation of blood clots.

**Relapse:** TTP can recur, and patients often require ongoing monitoring and potentially further treatment.  Rituximab maintenance therapy is commonly used to reduce the risk of relapse.

**Upshaw-Schulman Syndrome (USS):** This is a hereditary form of TTP caused by a deficiency of the ADAMTS13 enzyme.  Treatment for USS is similar to acquired TTP, often involving regular plasma infusions to replace the missing enzyme.

Who is at risk for Perineal Injury in Males? ?,"Men who have perineal surgery are most likely to have an acute perineal injury. Straddle injuries are most common among people who ride motorcycles, bikes, or horses and children who use playground equipment. Impalement injuries are most common in military personnel engaged in combat. Impalement injuries can also occur in construction or farm workers.
                
Chronic perineal injuries are most common in people who ride bikes as part of a job or sport, or in people with constipation.","Several groups of men are at risk for perineal injury, with the type of injury often related to the cause:

* **Acute Perineal Injuries:**
    * **Surgical Patients:** Men undergoing perineal surgery, including procedures involving the rectum, prostate, urethra, or scrotum, are at significant risk of acute perineal injury. This can include damage to nerves, muscles, and blood vessels in the area.
    * **Straddle Injuries:**  Men who ride bicycles, motorcycles, or horses, as well as children (though the question specifies men) using playground equipment, are at risk for straddle injuries to the perineum.  These injuries can range from bruising and lacerations to more severe damage to the urethra or pelvic organs.
    * **Impalement Injuries:** Though less common, impalement injuries to the perineum can occur.  Military personnel in combat situations are a particular group at risk, as are construction or farm workers who may experience accidents involving sharp objects.

* **Chronic Perineal Injuries:**
    * **Cyclists:**  Men who cycle frequently, particularly as a job (e.g., bike messengers) or for competitive sport, are at risk for chronic perineal injuries.  Pressure and friction from the saddle can lead to conditions like pudendal nerve entrapment, ischial bursitis, and chronic pain.
    * **Individuals with Constipation:** Chronic straining during bowel movements due to constipation can also contribute to perineal injury, including damage to the pelvic floor muscles and the development of hemorrhoids.


It's important to note that while these groups are at higher risk, perineal injury can occur in any male.  Seeking prompt medical attention for any perineal trauma is crucial for proper diagnosis and management to minimize potential complications.",0.7288,0.3234,0.1325,0.2395,8.9692
What is (are) Lactose Intolerance ?,"Lactose intolerance means that you cannot digest foods with lactose in them. Lactose is the sugar found in milk and foods made with milk. After eating foods with lactose in them, you may feel sick to your stomach. You may also have       -  Gas     -  Diarrhea     -  Swelling in your stomach        Your doctor may do a blood, breath or stool test to find out if your problems are due to lactose intolerance.    Lactose intolerance is not serious. Eating less food with lactose, or using pills or drops to help you digest lactose usually helps. You may need to take a calcium supplement if you don't get enough of it from your diet, since milk and foods made with milk are the most common source of calcium for most people.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases","Lactose intolerance is a condition characterized by the body's inability to fully digest lactose, a sugar primarily found in milk and dairy products. This impaired digestion is due to a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme produced in the small intestine. Lactase is responsible for breaking down lactose into simpler sugars (glucose and galactose) that can be absorbed into the bloodstream.

When lactase is insufficient or absent, undigested lactose passes into the large intestine.  There, it is fermented by bacteria, leading to the production of gases like hydrogen and methane. This fermentation process and the resulting byproducts are responsible for the common symptoms of lactose intolerance, which can include:

* **Gas:**  Increased gas production, leading to bloating and flatulence.
* **Diarrhea:**  Undigested lactose draws water into the colon, resulting in loose or watery stools.
* **Abdominal Cramping and Pain:**  Caused by the gas and bloating.
* **Nausea and Vomiting:** Less common, but can occur in some individuals.

There are different types of lactose intolerance:

* **Primary Lactase Deficiency:** This is the most common type and develops over time as lactase production decreases with age.
* **Secondary Lactase Deficiency:** This type results from injury or illness affecting the small intestine, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or gastroenteritis.
* **Congenital Lactase Deficiency:** A rare genetic condition where infants are born without the ability to produce lactase.
* **Developmental Lactase Deficiency:** Occurs in premature infants whose bodies are not yet producing sufficient lactase.


Diagnosis of lactose intolerance can involve several methods, including:

* **Lactose Tolerance Test:**  The patient drinks a lactose-containing beverage, and blood glucose levels are monitored.  Limited rise in glucose suggests lactose intolerance.
* **Hydrogen Breath Test:**  The patient drinks a lactose-containing beverage, and breath samples are analyzed for hydrogen gas, which is produced when undigested lactose is fermented in the colon.
* **Stool Acidity Test:**  Primarily used in infants and young children, this test measures the acidity of the stool, which can be increased due to undigested lactose.
* **Elimination Diet:**  Removing lactose-containing foods from the diet and observing symptom improvement can suggest lactose intolerance.

Management of lactose intolerance typically involves dietary modifications, such as reducing or eliminating lactose intake.  Lactase enzyme supplements (pills or drops) taken before consuming lactose-containing foods can also help.  It's important for individuals with lactose intolerance to ensure adequate calcium intake through alternative sources like calcium-fortified foods or supplements, as dairy products are a significant source of this essential nutrient.

While the information provided in the context is generally accurate, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for diagnosis and personalized management of lactose intolerance.  They can help determine the severity of the intolerance and recommend the most appropriate strategies for managing symptoms and ensuring adequate nutrition.",0.7798,0.2453,0.0581,0.1397,13.457
what research (or clinical trials) is being done for Glaucoma ?,"Through studies in the laboratory and with patients, the National Eye Institute is seeking better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with glaucoma. For example, researchers have discovered genes that could help explain how glaucoma damages the eye. NEI also is supporting studies to learn more about who is likely to get glaucoma, when to treat people who have increased eye pressure, and which treatment to use first.","Glaucoma research is a very active field.  While the context you provided mentions some general areas of investigation, I can elaborate on specific research areas and types of clinical trials currently underway for glaucoma:

**1. Neuroprotection and Regeneration:**  This is a major focus, aiming to protect the optic nerve from further damage and potentially regenerate lost nerve fibers.  Studies are investigating:

* **Neurotrophic factors:** These are proteins that support the survival and function of nerve cells. Clinical trials are exploring their potential to slow or reverse glaucoma progression.
* **Stem cell therapy:**  Researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to replace damaged retinal ganglion cells (the nerve cells that are damaged in glaucoma) and regenerate the optic nerve.
* **Gene therapy:**  Studies are exploring gene therapy approaches to protect retinal ganglion cells from damage and promote their survival.

**2. Early Detection and Risk Assessment:**  Identifying individuals at risk of developing glaucoma before significant vision loss occurs is crucial. Research efforts include:

* **Genetic studies:**  Identifying genes associated with glaucoma susceptibility can help identify individuals at higher risk.
* **Improved imaging techniques:**  Developing more sensitive imaging technologies, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual field testing, to detect early signs of glaucoma damage.
* **Biomarkers:**  Researchers are looking for biological markers in the eye or blood that can predict glaucoma development or progression.

**3. New Treatment Strategies:**

* **Novel drug therapies:** Research is ongoing to develop new drugs that lower intraocular pressure (IOP) through different mechanisms of action than existing medications.  This includes exploring drugs that improve blood flow to the optic nerve.
* **Sustained-release drug delivery systems:**  These systems aim to provide consistent IOP control over longer periods, reducing the burden of frequent eye drop administration. Examples include implants and injectable medications.
* **Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS):**  MIGS procedures offer less invasive surgical options for lowering IOP with faster recovery times compared to traditional glaucoma surgeries.  Research continues to refine these techniques and develop new MIGS devices.
* **Laser therapies:**  New laser procedures are being developed to improve the efficacy and safety of laser treatment for glaucoma.


**4. Understanding the Pathophysiology of Glaucoma:**  While elevated IOP is a major risk factor, glaucoma is a complex disease with multiple contributing factors.  Research continues to investigate:

* **The role of ocular blood flow:**  Impaired blood flow to the optic nerve may contribute to glaucoma damage, independent of IOP.
* **Immune system involvement:**  Studies are exploring the role of inflammation and the immune system in glaucoma development and progression.
* **The impact of other systemic diseases:**  Researchers are investigating the relationship between glaucoma and other conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

**Finding Clinical Trials:**

To find specific clinical trials related to glaucoma, you can search online databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov (a service of the U.S. National Institutes of Health) and the EU Clinical Trials Register.  These databases provide information on ongoing and completed clinical trials worldwide.  You can search by keyword (e.g., ""glaucoma,"" ""neuroprotection,"" ""MIGS"") or by location.

It's important to note that research is constantly evolving, and new discoveries are being made all the time.  Consulting with an ophthalmologist specializing in glaucoma is crucial for personalized advice and treatment options.",0.8097,0.1309,0.0168,0.0772,14.7683
What are the treatments for Dentinogenesis imperfecta ?,"How might dentinogenesis imperfecta be treated? The aims of treatment are to remove sources of infection or pain, restore aesthetics and protect posterior teeth from wear. Treatment varies according to the age of the patient, severity of the problem and the presenting complaint. Crowns, caps or other forms of dental care are the most commonly used treatments. Dentures or dental implants may be necessary if the majority of teeth are lost. More detailed information regarding the treatment of dentinogenesis imperfecta can be found by visiting the following web links: https://www.dentistry.unc.edu/dentalprofessionals/resources/defects/di/ http://www.ojrd.com/content/3/1/31","Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (DI) treatment focuses on improving aesthetics, managing pain, preventing further tooth wear, and addressing any associated complications.  The specific approach is highly individualized, depending on the patient's age, the severity of the DI, and the specific issues they are experiencing.  Treatments can range from conservative measures to more extensive interventions:

**Common Treatments:**

* **Overlays/Crowns:** These are frequently used to protect weakened teeth from wear and fracture, especially posterior (back) teeth.  Crowns provide full coverage, while overlays cover the biting surface and some of the sides of the tooth. Stainless steel crowns are often used in children due to their durability and adaptability to growing teeth.  For permanent teeth in adults, porcelain or ceramic crowns offer a more aesthetically pleasing option.
* **Composite Restorations:**  For less severe cases or smaller defects, composite resin can be used to restore tooth structure and improve aesthetics.
* **Extractions:** In cases of severe damage, infection, or pain that cannot be managed otherwise, tooth extraction may be necessary. This is often followed by replacement with dentures or implants.
* **Dentures:**  If multiple teeth are lost due to DI, dentures can provide a removable replacement for missing teeth and restore chewing function and aesthetics.
* **Dental Implants:**  A more permanent solution for missing teeth, dental implants offer a stable and long-lasting replacement.  They are surgically placed into the jawbone and can support individual crowns, bridges, or even full dentures.

**Adjunctive Treatments:**

* **Regular Dental Check-ups and Cleanings:**  Essential for early detection of problems and preventive care.  People with DI are at higher risk for cavities and other dental issues.
* **Sealants:**  Applying sealants to the chewing surfaces of teeth can help prevent cavities, especially in children.
* **Oral Hygiene Instructions:**  Proper brushing and flossing techniques are crucial to maintaining good oral health and minimizing complications.
* **Genetic Counseling:**  Since DI is a genetic condition, genetic counseling can be beneficial for individuals and families to understand the inheritance patterns and risks.

**Specific Considerations:**

* **Children:**  Treatment approaches for children often focus on protecting developing teeth and managing the challenges posed by the condition as the child grows.
* **Adults:**  Treatment in adults may focus more on restoring function and aesthetics, managing existing damage, and addressing any long-term consequences of DI.

**Important Note:**  The information provided here is for general knowledge and does not constitute medical advice.  It is essential to consult with a qualified dentist or dental specialist experienced in managing DI for a personalized treatment plan based on individual needs and circumstances.

What are the treatments for Pars planitis ?,"How might pars planitis be treated? The first approach to treating pars planitis is corticosteroid eye drops or injections near the eye to control inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including aspirin) or steroid medications (such as prednisone) can be taken by mouth. If these strategies are not successful, other medications may be given to reduce the body's immune response (medications called immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate).  If medications are not effective, surgery may be considered. Cryotherapy has been performed in affected people to remove eye tissue that has inflammation. Although this surgery has been shown to be effective in restoring clarity of vision, there are concerns that it may cause damage to other parts of the eye. Another surgery, known as vitrectomy, can be done to remove cloudy fluid (vitreous humor) from the eye.","Treatments for Pars Planitis typically follow a stepped approach, starting with less invasive options and escalating to more aggressive therapies if inflammation persists:

1. **Corticosteroids:**
    * **Topical:** Corticosteroid eye drops are often the first line of treatment to reduce inflammation in the eye.
    * **Periocular Injections:** Injections of corticosteroids around the eye (e.g., sub-Tenon's or retrobulbar injections) can deliver higher concentrations of the medication directly to the inflamed area when topical drops are insufficient.
    * **Systemic:** Oral corticosteroids like prednisone may be used for more severe cases or when local therapies are inadequate. However, systemic steroids carry a higher risk of side effects with long-term use.

2. **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** Oral NSAIDs may be used as an adjunct to corticosteroids or for milder cases, although their effectiveness in pars planitis is less well-established compared to corticosteroids.

3. **Immunosuppressants:** When corticosteroids and NSAIDs fail to control inflammation, immunosuppressive medications like methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil may be prescribed. These medications work by suppressing the immune system's response, which is thought to play a role in pars planitis.

4. **Surgical Interventions:**  Reserved for cases unresponsive to medical therapies.
    * **Cryotherapy:** This procedure involves freezing the affected tissue to reduce inflammation. While potentially effective, it carries risks of complications, including damage to surrounding healthy eye structures.  It is less commonly used now due to the availability of effective immunomodulatory therapies.
    * **Vitrectomy:** This surgery removes the vitreous humor (the gel-like substance filling the eye). It can be helpful in cases with significant vitreous opacities that impair vision.  It is sometimes combined with the injection of long-acting corticosteroids into the vitreous cavity.

**Important Considerations:**

What is (are) Herpes Zoster Oticus ?,"Herpes zoster oticus is a common complication of shingles, an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (which is the virus that also causes chickenpox). Shingles occurs in people who have had chickenpox and the varicella-zoster virus becomes active again. Herpes zoster oticus is caused by the spread of the virus to facial nerves and can cause intense ear pain; a rash around the ear, mouth, face, neck, and scalp; and paralysis of the face. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, vertigo (feeling that the room is spinning), tinnitus (hearing abnormal sounds), loss of taste in the tongue, and dry mouth and eyes. Some cases of herpes zoster oticus do not require treatment, but when treatment is needed, pain medications, antiviral drugs or corticosteroids may be prescribed. Vertigo is sometimes treated with medication as well. The prognosis of herpes zoster oticus is typically good but in some cases, hearing loss or facial paralysis may be permanent.","Herpes zoster oticus (HZO), also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II, is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve.  This ganglion is a collection of nerve cell bodies located near the inner ear.  While the same virus causes chickenpox and shingles, HZO specifically refers to VZV reactivation affecting the facial nerve and surrounding structures.

Here's a breakdown of key features:

* **Cause:** Reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the geniculate ganglion.  This reactivation is thought to be triggered by a weakened immune system due to factors like aging, stress, or other illnesses.
* **Symptoms:**
    * **Pain:**  Often severe and sharp pain deep within the ear is a hallmark symptom.
    * **Rash:**  A characteristic vesicular (blister-like) rash typically appears on the ear (especially the pinna and external auditory canal), and may also spread to the face, mouth, neck, and scalp.
    * **Facial Paralysis (Bell's Palsy):**  Weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face.  This can affect the ability to close the eye, smile, or raise an eyebrow on the affected side.
    * **Auditory Symptoms:**  Hearing loss (often sensorineural), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), and vertigo (dizziness or a spinning sensation) are common.
    * **Other Symptoms:**  Loss of taste on the affected side of the tongue (ageusia), dry mouth (xerostomia), and dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can also occur.

* **Diagnosis:**  Diagnosis is typically based on clinical presentation, particularly the combination of ear pain, a characteristic rash, and facial paralysis.  Laboratory tests, such as PCR for VZV DNA from vesicle fluid or serologic testing, can confirm the diagnosis.

* **Treatment:** Prompt antiviral therapy (e.g., acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) is crucial to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, particularly facial paralysis and hearing loss.  Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) are often prescribed concurrently to reduce inflammation and nerve swelling.  Pain management is also essential and may involve analgesics or other pain medications.  Vestibular suppressants can help manage vertigo.

* **Prognosis:** While most patients recover fully, some may experience long-term complications such as permanent facial paralysis, hearing loss, or tinnitus.  Early diagnosis and treatment are critical for improving the prognosis.

Who is at risk for Parasites - Lice - Head Lice? ?,"In the United States, infestation with head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) is most common among preschool- and elementary school-age children and their household members and caretakers. Head lice are not known to transmit disease; however, secondary bacterial infection of the skin resulting from scratching can occur with any lice infestation.
    
Getting head lice is not related to cleanliness of the person or his or her environment.
    
Head lice are mainly spread by direct contact with the hair of an infested person. The most common way to get head lice is by head-to-head contact with a person who already has head lice. Such contact can be common among children during play at:
    
     - school,
     - home, and
     - elsewhere (e.g., sports activities, playgrounds, camp, and slumber parties).
    
    
Uncommonly, transmission may occur by:
    
     - wearing clothing, such as hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms, or hair ribbons worn by an infested person;
     - using infested combs, brushes or towels; or
     - lying on a bed, couch, pillow, carpet, or stuffed animal that has recently been in contact with an infested person.
    
    
Reliable data on how many people get head lice each year in the United States are not available; however, an estimated 6 million to 12 million infestations occur each year in the United States among children 3 to 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that girls get head lice more often than boys, probably due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
    
In the United States, infestation with head lice is much less common among African-Americans than among persons of other races. The head louse found most frequently in the United States may have claws that are better adapted for grasping the shape and width of some types of hair but not others.","Individuals at highest risk for head lice infestation include:

* **Preschool and elementary school-aged children (3-11 years old):** This age group is most commonly affected due to close contact during play and activities at school, home, and other social settings.
* **Household members and caretakers of infested children:** Close contact within the household facilitates the spread of lice.
* **Girls:**  Studies suggest girls may be more prone to head lice than boys, possibly due to more frequent head-to-head contact.
* **People of non-African American descent:** Head lice infestations are less common among African Americans in the United States, possibly due to differences in hair texture and the louse's claw adaptation.


While less common, anyone can get head lice through contact with belongings (hats, scarves, combs, bedding) used by an infested person.  It's important to note that head lice infestation is *not* related to personal hygiene or cleanliness of the environment.",0.7324,0.482,0.2127,0.2297,6.7459
What is (are) oral-facial-digital syndrome ?,"Oral-facial-digital syndrome is actually a group of related conditions that affect the development of the oral cavity (the mouth and teeth), facial features, and digits (fingers and toes).  Researchers have identified at least 13 potential forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome. The different types are classified by their patterns of signs and symptoms. However, the features of the various types overlap significantly, and some types are not well defined. The classification system for oral-facial-digital syndrome continues to evolve as researchers find more affected individuals and learn more about this disorder.  The signs and symptoms of oral-facial-digital syndrome vary widely. However, most forms of this disorder involve problems with development of the oral cavity, facial features, and digits. Most forms are also associated with brain abnormalities and some degree of intellectual disability.  Abnormalities of the oral cavity that occur in many types of oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split (cleft) in the tongue, a tongue with an unusual lobed shape, and the growth of noncancerous tumors or nodules on the tongue. Affected individuals may also have extra, missing, or defective teeth. Another common feature is an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). Some people with oral-facial-digital syndrome have bands of extra tissue (called hyperplastic frenula) that abnormally attach the lip to the gums.  Distinctive facial features often associated with oral-facial-digital syndrome include a split in the lip (a cleft lip); a wide nose with a broad, flat nasal bridge; and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism).  Abnormalities of the digits can affect both the fingers and the toes in people with oral-facial-digital syndrome. These abnormalities include fusion of certain fingers or toes (syndactyly), digits that are shorter than usual (brachydactyly), or digits that are unusually curved (clinodactyly). The presence of extra digits (polydactyly) is also seen in most forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome.  Other features occur in only one or a few types of oral-facial digital syndrome. These features help distinguish the different forms of the disorder. For example, the most common form of oral-facial-digital syndrome, type I, is associated with polycystic kidney disease. This kidney disease is characterized by the growth of fluid-filled sacs (cysts) that interfere with the kidneys' ability to filter waste products from the blood. Other forms of oral-facial-digital syndrome are characterized by neurological problems, particular changes in the structure of the brain, bone abnormalities, vision loss, and heart defects.","Oral-facial-digital syndrome (OFDS) is a group of at least 13 related congenital disorders primarily characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity, and digits.  These syndromes share overlapping features, making diagnosis and classification complex and continually evolving.  While the specific signs and symptoms vary widely between the different types of OFDS, several key features are often present:

**Oral Cavity Abnormalities:**

* **Cleft lip and/or palate:**  Openings or splits in the lip and/or the roof of the mouth.
* **Tongue abnormalities:**  Including cleft tongue (bifid tongue), lobulated tongue, and lingual hamartomas (benign growths).
* **Dental abnormalities:**  Such as missing teeth (hypodontia), extra teeth (hyperdontia), or abnormally shaped teeth.
* **Hyperplastic frenula:**  Abnormal bands of tissue connecting the lip to the gums.

**Facial Features:**

* **Wide nasal bridge:**  Giving the nose a broad, flattened appearance.
* **Hypertelorism:**  Widely spaced eyes.
* **Cleft lip:**  As mentioned above, this can be a shared feature with oral cavity abnormalities.

**Digital Abnormalities:**

* **Syndactyly:**  Fusion or webbing of fingers and/or toes.
* **Brachydactyly:**  Shortened fingers and/or toes.
* **Clinodactyly:**  Curved fingers and/or toes.
* **Polydactyly:**  Extra fingers and/or toes.

**Other Features:**

In addition to the core triad of oral, facial, and digital abnormalities, individuals with OFDS can present with a range of other findings, some specific to certain subtypes:

* **Intellectual disability:**  Varying degrees of cognitive impairment are common.
* **Brain abnormalities:**  Structural brain anomalies can occur, contributing to neurological issues.
* **Polycystic kidney disease (PCKD):**  Specifically associated with OFDS type I, characterized by the formation of cysts in the kidneys.
* **Bone abnormalities:**  Skeletal dysplasia can be present in some forms of OFDS.
* **Vision loss:**  Ocular defects can contribute to visual impairment.
* **Heart defects:**  Congenital heart conditions can occur in certain subtypes.


**Important Considerations:**

* The variability in symptoms and the overlap between OFDS subtypes necessitate a thorough clinical evaluation for diagnosis.
* Genetic testing may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and identifying the specific subtype.
* Management of OFDS involves a multidisciplinary approach, addressing the specific needs of each individual.  This may include surgical interventions, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and other supportive care.

While this information provides a general overview of OFDS, it's crucial to consult with a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.  Genetic counseling is also recommended for affected individuals and their families.

What are the genetic changes related to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"The genes involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency each provide instructions for making a protein that is a component of a group of proteins called the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produce energy for cells.  The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is made up of multiple copies of several enzymes called E1, E2, and E3, each of which performs part of the chemical reaction that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. In addition, other proteins included in the complex ensure its proper function. One of these proteins, E3 binding protein, attaches E3 to the complex and provides the correct structure for the complex to perform its function. Other associated proteins control the activity of the complex: pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase turns on (activates) the complex, while pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase turns off (inhibits) the complex.  The E1 enzyme, also called pyruvate dehydrogenase, is composed of four parts (subunits): two alpha subunits (called E1 alpha) and two beta subunits (called E1 beta). Mutations in the gene that provides instructions for making E1 alpha, the PDHA1 gene, are the most common cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, accounting for approximately 80 percent of cases. These mutations lead to a shortage of E1 alpha protein or result in an abnormal protein that cannot function properly. A decrease in functional E1 alpha leads to reduced activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.  Other components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are also involved in pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Mutations in the genes that provide instructions for E1 beta (the PDHB gene), the E2 enzyme (the DLAT gene), E3 binding protein (the PDHX gene), and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (the PDP1 gene) have been identified in people with this condition. Although it is unclear how mutations in each of these genes affect the complex, reduced functioning of one component of the complex appears to impair the activity of the whole complex. As with PDHA1 gene mutations, changes in these other genes lead to a reduction of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity.  With decreased function of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted in another chemical reaction to lactic acid. The excess lactic acid causes lactic acidosis in affected individuals. In addition, the production of cellular energy is diminished. The brain, which requires especially large amounts of energy, is severely affected, resulting in the neurological problems associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.","The genetic changes related to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency primarily involve mutations in genes encoding components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). These include:

* **PDHA1:** This gene encodes the E1 alpha subunit of the PDC. Mutations in *PDHA1* are the most common cause (approximately 80%) of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. These mutations can lead to a shortage of E1 alpha protein or produce a dysfunctional protein, ultimately reducing PDC activity. (Source: GeneReviews - Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency)

* **PDHB:** This gene encodes the E1 beta subunit of the PDC. Mutations in *PDHB* are less common than *PDHA1* mutations but can similarly impair PDC function.

* **DLAT:** This gene encodes the E2 component (dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase) of the PDC. Mutations in *DLAT* can disrupt the normal function of the complex.

* **PDHX:** This gene encodes the E3 binding protein, which is essential for the proper structure and function of the PDC. Mutations in *PDHX* can affect the stability and activity of the complex.

* **PDP1:** This gene encodes pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, an enzyme that activates the PDC. Mutations in *PDP1* can lead to reduced PDC activity due to impaired activation.


While the exact mechanisms by which mutations in *PDHB*, *DLAT*, *PDHX*, and *PDP1* affect the PDC are not always fully elucidated, it is generally understood that a deficiency in any component of the complex can impair the overall function of the PDC, leading to reduced conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and subsequent energy production deficits.  This ultimately leads to the accumulation of pyruvate and its conversion to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis and the neurological problems characteristic of this condition.  It's important to note that the severity of the deficiency can vary depending on the specific mutation and the degree of residual enzyme activity.

Is Hirschsprung's disease inherited ?,"Is Hirschsprung's disease inherited? Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) usually occurs occurs by itself without other symptoms and is called isolated HSCR. Isolated HSCR has multifactorial inheritance, which means that multiple genes interact with environmental factors to cause the condition. When someone has a child with isolated HSCR, the overall risk to have another child with the condition is 4%. There are some factors that can change the risk. For example, the risk is higher if the sibling has long-segment disease rather than short-segment disease. Also males are more likely than females to develop HSCR. Another factor is if the siblings have the same or different parents.  If HSCR occurs as part of a genetic syndrome, then it is inherited in a specific pattern. For example, the inheritance may be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive, depending on the exact cause of the syndrome.  Individuals who are interested in learning about their personal risks or risks to family members should speak with their health care provider or a genetics professional.","Yes, Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) has a hereditary component.  However, the inheritance pattern can be complex.

* **Isolated HSCR:**  Most cases of HSCR are isolated, meaning they occur without other associated birth defects or syndromes.  This form of HSCR follows a multifactorial inheritance pattern.  This means multiple genes contribute to the risk, along with environmental factors.  While not a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern, there is a demonstrable increased risk for siblings of affected children (around 4% overall). This risk can be modified by factors like the sex of the sibling (males at higher risk), the length of the affected segment in the initial child (longer segment increases risk), and whether the siblings share both parents.

* **Syndromic HSCR:**  HSCR can also occur as part of a genetic syndrome.  In these cases, the inheritance pattern follows the specific syndrome's genetic basis, which could be autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive, among others.

It's important to note that the provided context accurately reflects the current understanding of HSCR inheritance.  For personalized risk assessment, consultation with a geneticist or genetic counselor is crucial.

How to diagnose Glomerular Diseases ?,"Patients with glomerular disease have significant amounts of protein in the urine, which may be referred to as ""nephrotic range"" if levels are very high. Red blood cells in the urine are a frequent finding as well, particularly in some forms of glomerular disease. Urinalysis provides information about kidney damage by indicating levels of protein and red blood cells in the urine. Blood tests measure the levels of waste products such as creatinine and urea nitrogen to determine whether the filtering capacity of the kidneys is impaired. If these lab tests indicate kidney damage, the doctor may recommend ultrasound or an x ray to see whether the shape or size of the kidneys is abnormal. These tests are called renal imaging. But since glomerular disease causes problems at the cellular level, the doctor will probably also recommend a kidney biopsya procedure in which a needle is used to extract small pieces of tissue for examination with different types of microscopes, each of which shows a different aspect of the tissue. A biopsy may be helpful in confirming glomerular disease and identifying the cause.","Diagnosing glomerular disease involves a multi-step process, moving from less invasive tests to more definitive procedures:

1. **Urinalysis:** This is the initial and crucial step.  It detects the presence of protein (proteinuria) and red blood cells (hematuria) in the urine, which are key indicators of potential glomerular damage.  Significant proteinuria, sometimes referred to as ""nephrotic range"" proteinuria, is a particularly strong indicator.

2. **Blood Tests:**  These assess kidney function by measuring waste products like creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Elevated levels suggest impaired kidney filtration, a common consequence of glomerular disease.  Other blood tests may include assessing for antibodies associated with specific glomerular diseases (e.g., anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) and complement levels.

3. **Renal Imaging (Ultrasound/X-ray):**  While not specific for glomerular disease, imaging techniques like ultrasound or X-ray can reveal abnormalities in kidney size, shape, or structure, which can support the diagnosis or suggest other contributing factors.

4. **Kidney Biopsy:** This is the gold standard for diagnosing and classifying glomerular diseases.  A small tissue sample is obtained via a needle and examined under a microscope.  This allows for a detailed evaluation of the glomeruli, identifying specific patterns of injury and guiding treatment decisions. Different microscopy techniques, such as light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, are used to provide a comprehensive assessment.  The biopsy helps determine the specific type of glomerular disease (e.g., IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease).

It's important to note that the decision to perform a kidney biopsy is made based on the clinical presentation, the results of the initial tests, and the potential benefits and risks of the procedure.  Not all patients with proteinuria or hematuria will require a biopsy.",0.847,0.4553,0.141,0.2043,11.0321
What is (are) Autoimmune myocarditis ?,"Autoimmune myocarditis is an autoimmune disease that affects the heart. The condition is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). Some people with autoimmune myocarditis have no noticeable symptoms of the condition. When present, signs and symptoms may include chest pain, abnormal heartbeat, shortness of breath, fatigue, signs of infection (i.e. fever, headache, sore throat, diarrhea), and leg swelling. The exact underlying cause of the condition is currently unknown; however, autoimmune conditions, in general, occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person. In some cases, medications that suppress the immune system may be recommended.","Autoimmune myocarditis is a form of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) where the body's own immune system mistakenly attacks the myocardium.  This immune system dysfunction leads to inflammation and damage to the heart muscle, which can impair its ability to pump blood effectively.

While the provided context gives a good overview, it's important to elaborate on a few points:

* **Causes:**  While the exact trigger for autoimmune myocarditis is often unknown, several factors are suspected to play a role:
    * **Infections:** Viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections can sometimes trigger an abnormal immune response that mistakenly targets the heart.  
    * **Medications:** Certain medications can rarely induce an immune reaction leading to myocarditis.
    * **Other Autoimmune Diseases:**  Autoimmune myocarditis can occur in conjunction with other autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease.
    * **Genetic Predisposition:** Some individuals may have a genetic susceptibility to developing autoimmune diseases, including autoimmune myocarditis.

* **Symptoms:** As mentioned in the context, symptoms can range from asymptomatic to severe.  The severity and presentation of symptoms can vary significantly depending on the extent of myocardial inflammation and damage.  It's important to note that some individuals may initially experience flu-like symptoms before developing more specific cardiac symptoms.

* **Diagnosis:** Diagnosing autoimmune myocarditis can be challenging. It often involves a combination of:
    * **Blood tests:**  Looking for markers of inflammation and autoantibodies.
    * **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** To detect abnormalities in heart rhythm.
    * **Echocardiogram:**  To assess heart function and look for structural abnormalities.
    * **Cardiac MRI:** To visualize the myocardium and assess the extent of inflammation.
    * **Endomyocardial biopsy:** This is the gold standard for diagnosis, involving taking a small tissue sample from the heart muscle for examination. However, it is an invasive procedure and not always performed.

* **Treatment:**  Treatment aims to reduce inflammation, manage symptoms, and prevent further heart damage.  This may include:
    * **Immunosuppressive medications:** such as corticosteroids and other immunomodulatory agents to dampen the immune response.
    * **Heart failure medications:** if heart function is significantly impaired.
    * **Lifestyle modifications:**  such as sodium restriction and fluid management.
    * **Treatment of underlying conditions:** If associated with another autoimmune disease, managing that condition is crucial.


* **Prognosis:** The prognosis for autoimmune myocarditis varies widely depending on the severity of the inflammation and the individual's response to treatment.  Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential for improving outcomes.  Some individuals may recover completely, while others may develop chronic heart damage and heart failure.

NIH: National Cancer Institute","Vaginal cancer is a rare malignancy that originates in the vagina, the muscular canal connecting the uterus to the outside of the body.  While it can occur at any age, it is most common in women over 60.  Several risk factors increase the likelihood of developing vaginal cancer:

* **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection:**  HPV, particularly high-risk strains like HPV 16 and 18, is a significant risk factor for several cancers, including vaginal cancer.  Persistent infection with these strains can lead to precancerous changes in the vaginal lining, which may progress to cancer if left untreated.

* **In Utero Diethylstilbestrol (DES) Exposure:**  Women whose mothers took DES during pregnancy to prevent miscarriage have a substantially increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina, a specific type of vaginal cancer.  This risk persists even decades after exposure.

* **History of Precancerous or Cancerous Conditions:**  A history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or cervical cancer increases the risk of developing vaginal cancer.

* **Other Risk Factors:**  Other potential risk factors include smoking, HIV infection, and a weakened immune system.


Early vaginal cancer often has no noticeable symptoms.  However, as the disease progresses, symptoms may include:

* **Abnormal Vaginal Bleeding:** This can include bleeding after intercourse, between periods, or after menopause.
* **Vaginal Discharge:**  Unusual or persistent vaginal discharge, which may be watery, bloody, or foul-smelling.
* **A Vaginal Lump or Mass:** A palpable lump or thickening in the vaginal wall.
* **Pelvic Pain:**  Pain in the pelvic area, which can be persistent or intermittent.
* **Painful Urination:**  Discomfort or pain during urination.


**Diagnosis:**

Regular pelvic exams and Pap tests are crucial for early detection.  A Pap test can detect abnormal cells in the vagina, which can then be further evaluated with a colposcopy and biopsy to confirm a diagnosis.

**Treatment:**

Treatment options for vaginal cancer depend on the stage and type of cancer, as well as the patient's overall health.  Common treatments include:

* **Surgery:**  Surgical removal of the tumor, part of the vagina, or, in advanced cases, the entire vagina and surrounding tissues.
* **Radiation Therapy:**  Uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.  This can be delivered externally or internally (brachytherapy).

The Physical Exam During the physical exam, your doctor will look for signs of P.A.D. He or she may check the blood flow in your legs or feet to see whether you have weak or absent pulses. Your doctor also may check the pulses in your leg arteries for an abnormal whooshing sound called a bruit (broo-E). He or she can hear this sound with a stethoscope. A bruit may be a warning sign of a narrowed or blocked artery. Your doctor may compare blood pressure between your limbs to see whether the pressure is lower in the affected limb. He or she may also check for poor wound healing or any changes in your hair, skin, or nails that might be signs of P.A.D. Diagnostic Tests Tests are used to diagnose P.A.D. These tests include - an ankle-brachial index (ABI). This test compares blood pressure in your ankle to blood pressure in your arm and shows how well blood is flowing in your limbs. ABI can show whether P.A.D. is affecting your limbs, but it wont show which blood vessels are narrowed or blocked. A normal ABI result is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30).

These tests check for P.A.D. risk factors such as diabetes and high blood cholesterol levels.","Diagnosis of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) involves a combination of medical history assessment, physical examination, and diagnostic tests.

**1. Medical and Family History:**  The physician will inquire about:

* **Risk factors:** Smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, family history of PAD or other cardiovascular diseases.
* **Symptoms:**  Pain, numbness, or cramping in the legs, calves, or feet, especially during exercise (intermittent claudication); pain that occurs at rest; slow-healing sores or wounds on the legs or feet; changes in skin color or temperature of the legs or feet.
* **Diet and Medications:**  Assessing dietary habits and current medications (prescription and over-the-counter).

**2. Physical Examination:**

* **Pulse palpation:** Checking for weak or absent pulses in the legs and feet.
* **Auscultation:** Listening for bruits (abnormal whooshing sounds) over arteries, which may indicate narrowing.
* **Blood pressure comparison:** Comparing blood pressure between limbs; lower pressure in the affected limb suggests PAD.
* **Skin assessment:** Evaluating skin color, temperature, hair growth, and wound healing in the legs and feet.

**3. Diagnostic Tests:**

* **Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):**  Compares blood pressure in the ankle to blood pressure in the arm. An ABI of 0.90 or less is indicative of PAD.  A normal ABI is 1.0 or greater (with a range of 0.90 to 1.30).
* **Doppler Ultrasound:** Uses sound waves to visualize blood flow in the arteries and veins of the limbs.  Can identify blockages and assess the severity of PAD.
* **Treadmill Test (Exercise Testing):**  Assesses symptoms and changes in ABI during exercise, helping to determine the severity of PAD.
* **Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA):**  Uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of blood vessels. Can identify blockages and their severity.  Contraindicated in patients with certain metallic implants.
* **Arteriogram (Angiography):**  An invasive test involving injecting contrast dye into an artery and taking X-rays to visualize blood flow and identify blockages. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), a type of arteriogram using tiny ultrasound cameras inside the blood vessels, may also be used.
* **Blood Tests:**  To assess risk factors for PAD, including diabetes (blood glucose levels) and high cholesterol (lipid panel).

What are the treatments for Rotor syndrome ?,"How might Rotor syndrome be treated? Rotor syndrome is considered a benign disorder and does not require treatment. While no adverse drug reactions have been reported in people with Rotor syndrome, a number of commonly used drugs and/or their metabolites may have serious consequences in affected people. This is because some drugs enter the liver via one of the two transporter proteins that are absent in affected people. People with Rotor syndrome should make sure all of their health care providers are aware of their diagnosis and should check with their health care providers regarding drugs that should be avoided.","Rotor syndrome is considered a benign condition and does **not** require specific treatment.  The focus of management is avoiding medications that may be problematic due to impaired liver transport.  Since Rotor syndrome affects the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter proteins in the liver, certain drugs and their metabolites may accumulate to higher levels than in individuals without the syndrome.  Therefore, individuals with Rotor syndrome should inform all their healthcare providers about their diagnosis to ensure appropriate medication choices.

What are the symptoms of Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Hyperkeratosis 90% Verrucae 90% Abnormality of the nail 50% Hyperhidrosis 50% Acrokeratosis - Autosomal dominant inheritance - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa is characterized by the following symptoms, with approximate frequencies based on available data (primarily from Orphanet):

* **Hyperkeratosis (90%):**  Thickening of the outer layer of the skin (stratum corneum).  This can manifest as rough, dry, or scaly skin.
* **Verrucae (90%):**  Also known as warts, these are small, rough growths on the skin caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV).  In Acrokeratoelastoidosis, these are typically found on the hands and feet.
* **Abnormality of the nail (50%):**  This can include a variety of nail changes, such as thickening, discoloration, brittleness, or abnormal growth patterns.
* **Hyperhidrosis (50%):** Excessive sweating, particularly affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.
* **Acrokeratosis:**  This term is a general descriptor for skin conditions affecting the extremities.  Since Acrokeratoelastoidosis *is* a type of acrokeratosis, its inclusion here simply reinforces that the condition primarily affects the hands and feet.  It's not a distinct symptom in itself.  The autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is a feature of the disease's genetics, not a symptom.


It's important to note that these percentages are estimates and can vary between studies.  A diagnosis of Acrokeratoelastoidosis of Costa requires a thorough clinical evaluation by a dermatologist or other qualified medical professional.

How to diagnose Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors ?,"Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor:                -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Blood levels of the tumor markers help determine if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Sometimes a CT scan and a PET scan are done at the same time. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy used depends on where the extragonadal germ cell tumor is found.                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or sample of tissue.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.","Diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors (EGCTs) involves a combination of physical examination, imaging, and blood tests to determine the presence, location, and type of tumor.  While the provided context lists common procedures, here's a more structured approach:

**1. Initial Evaluation:**

* **Physical Exam and History:** This is the first step, focusing on any palpable masses, symptoms (e.g., pain, swelling), and risk factors.  The location of any mass is crucial, given the extragonadal nature of these tumors.  Testicular examination is important to rule out a primary testicular GCT with metastasis.
* **Serum Tumor Markers:**  Measuring AFP, β-hCG, and LDH is essential. Elevated levels of these markers strongly suggest a germ cell tumor and can help differentiate between seminoma and nonseminoma subtypes.  It's important to note that not all EGCTs produce elevated markers.

**2. Imaging Studies:**

* **Chest X-ray:** This can identify lung metastases, a common site of spread for EGCTs.
* **CT Scan (with or without contrast):** CT is the primary imaging modality for localizing and characterizing EGCTs. It provides detailed information about the tumor's size, location, and relationship to surrounding structures.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is usually performed.
* **PET/CT Scan:**  This combined imaging technique can be helpful in staging the disease and assessing treatment response.  It's particularly useful for detecting small metastatic deposits that might be missed on CT alone.
* **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** While CT is generally preferred, MRI may be used in specific situations, such as evaluating tumors in the brain or spine.

**3. Biopsy:**

* **Histopathological confirmation is crucial for a definitive diagnosis.** The biopsy method depends on the tumor's location and accessibility. Options include:
    * **Excisional biopsy:** Removal of the entire tumor.
    * **Incisional biopsy:** Removal of a portion of the tumor.
    * **Core needle biopsy:**  Obtaining a tissue sample using a larger needle.
    * **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy:** Obtaining cells using a thin needle.

The choice of biopsy technique is made by the physician based on factors like tumor location, size, and accessibility.  The obtained tissue is examined by a pathologist to confirm the presence of a germ cell tumor and classify its subtype (seminoma, nonseminoma, or mixed).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Differential Diagnosis:**  Other conditions can mimic EGCTs, so it's important to consider alternative diagnoses.
* **Multidisciplinary Approach:**  Managing EGCTs often involves a team of specialists, including oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists.

**In summary,** diagnosing EGCTs relies on a combination of clinical findings, serum tumor markers, imaging studies, and ultimately, histopathological confirmation from a biopsy.  A thorough evaluation is essential for accurate diagnosis, staging, and treatment planning.",0.8707,0.4281,0.1274,0.1962,15.0114

People with cirrhosis should be careful about starting new medications and should consult a health care provider before taking prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or vitamins. People with cirrhosis should avoid complementary and alternative medications, such as herbs.
                
Cirrhosis slows the livers ability to filter medications from the blood. When this slowdown occurs, medications act longer than expected and build up in the body. Some medications and vitamins may also affect liver function.
                
Viral Hepatitis Vaccination and Screening
                
All people with cirrhosis should consider vaccination against hepatitis A and B. An infection with one of these hepatitis viruses can cause cirrhosis to get worse. Vaccination can easily prevent both infections.
                
People with cirrhosis should also get a screening blood test for hepatitis C.
                
Treating Causes of Cirrhosis
                
Health care providers can treat some causes of cirrhosis, for example, by prescribing antiviral medications for hepatitis B and C. In some instances, these medications cure the viral infection. Health care providers treat autoimmune hepatitis with corticosteroids and other medications that suppress the immune system. Health care providers can treat hemochromatosis and Wilson diseaseinherited forms of liver disease caused by the buildup of iron or copper in the liverif detected early. Health care providers usually treat liver diseases due to blockage or loss of bile ducts with ursodiol (Actigall, Urso). Ursodiol is a nontoxic bile acid that people can take orally. Ursodiol replaces the bile acids that are normally produced by the liver, which are toxic and build up in the liver when the bile ducts are blocked.
                
Treating Symptoms and Complications of Cirrhosis
                
Itching and abdominal pain. A health care provider may give medications to treat various symptoms of cirrhosis, such as itching and abdominal pain.
                
Portal hypertension. A health care provider may prescribe a beta-blocker or nitrate to treat portal hypertension. Beta-blockers lower blood pressure by helping the heart beat slower and with less force, and nitrates relax and widen blood vessels to let more blood flow to the heart and reduce the hearts workload.
                
Varices. Beta-blockers can lower the pressure in varices and reduce the likelihood of bleeding. Bleeding in the stomach or esophagus requires an immediate upper endoscopy. This procedure involves using an endoscopea small, flexible tube with a lightto look for varices. The health care provider may use the endoscope to perform a band ligation, a procedure that involves placing a special rubber band around the varices that causes the tissue to die and fall off. A gastroenterologista doctor who specializes in digestive diseasesperforms the procedure at a hospital or an outpatient center. People who have had varices in the past may need to take medication to prevent future episodes.
                
Edema and ascites. Health care providers prescribe diureticsmedications that remove fluid from the bodyto treat edema and ascites. A health care provider may remove large amounts of ascitic fluid from the abdomen and check for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A health care provider may prescribe bacteria-fighting medications called antibiotics to prevent infection. He or she may prescribe oral antibiotics; however, severe infection with ascites requires intravenous (IV) antibiotics.
                
Hepatic encephalopathy. A health care provider treats hepatic encephalopathy by cleansing the bowel with lactulose, a laxative given orally or as an enemaa liquid put into the rectum. A health care provider may also add antibiotics to the treatment. Hepatic encephalopathy may improve as other complications of cirrhosis are controlled.
                
Hepatorenal syndrome. Some people with cirrhosis who develop hepatorenal syndrome must undergo regular dialysis treatment, which filters wastes and extra fluid from the body by means other than the kidneys. People may also need medications to improve blood flow through the kidneys.
                
Osteoporosis. A health care provider may prescribe bisphosphonate medications to improve bone density.
                
Gallstones and bile duct stones. A health care provider may use surgery to remove gallstones. He or she may use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which uses balloons and basketlike devices, to retrieve the bile duct stones.
                
Liver cancer. A health care provider may recommend screening tests every 6 to 12 months to check for signs of liver cancer. Screening tests can find cancer before the person has symptoms of the disease. Cancer treatment is usually more effective when the health care provider finds the disease early. Health care providers use blood tests, ultrasound, or both to screen for liver cancer in people with cirrhosis. He or she may treat cancer with a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.","Treatments for cirrhosis focus on managing the underlying cause, preventing further liver damage, and treating complications.  Here's a summary based on the provided text:

**1. Lifestyle Modifications:**

* **Abstinence from Alcohol and Illicit Drugs:**  Crucial to stop further liver damage.

**2. Medication Management:**

* **Caution with New Medications:**  Consult a healthcare provider before starting any new medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and especially herbal or alternative remedies. Cirrhosis impairs the liver's ability to process medications, leading to potential accumulation and adverse effects.

**3. Prevention of Infections:**

* **Hepatitis A and B Vaccination:**  Recommended for all cirrhosis patients to prevent further liver damage.
* **Hepatitis C Screening:**  Essential to identify and treat this potentially contributing factor.

**4. Treating Underlying Causes:**

* **Viral Hepatitis (B and C):** Antiviral medications can sometimes cure the infection.
* **Autoimmune Hepatitis:** Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants.
* **Hemochromatosis and Wilson Disease:**  Early treatment can manage these genetic conditions that cause iron or copper accumulation in the liver.
* **Bile Duct Blockage:** Ursodiol (Actigall, Urso) can replace toxic bile acids that build up due to blockage.

**5. Managing Symptoms and Complications:**

* **Itching and Abdominal Pain:** Medications can provide relief.
* **Portal Hypertension (Increased pressure in the portal vein):** Beta-blockers and nitrates can lower portal vein pressure.
* **Varices (Enlarged veins in the esophagus and stomach):** Beta-blockers can reduce bleeding risk. Endoscopic band ligation can treat bleeding varices.
* **Edema (Swelling) and Ascites (Fluid buildup in the abdomen):** Diuretics help remove excess fluid. Paracentesis (fluid removal) may be necessary for ascites. Antibiotics can prevent or treat spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
* **Hepatic Encephalopathy (Brain dysfunction due to liver failure):** Lactulose (laxative) and antibiotics can help clear toxins from the body.
* **Hepatorenal Syndrome (Kidney failure due to cirrhosis):** Dialysis and medications to improve kidney blood flow.
* **Osteoporosis (Weakened bones):** Bisphosphonates can improve bone density.
* **Gallstones and Bile Duct Stones:** Surgical removal or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used.
* **Liver Cancer:** Regular screening (every 6-12 months) with blood tests and/or ultrasound is crucial for early detection. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

What causes Adult Central Nervous System Tumors ?,The cause of most adult brain and spinal cord tumors is not known.,"While the exact cause of most adult central nervous system (CNS) tumors remains unknown, research has identified several risk factors and potential contributing factors.  It's important to understand that having a risk factor doesn't guarantee developing a tumor, and many individuals with these risk factors never will. Conversely, individuals without known risk factors can still develop CNS tumors.

Here's a breakdown of what we know:

**1. Genetic Predisposition:**

* **Inherited Syndromes:** Certain inherited genetic syndromes significantly increase the risk of CNS tumors. Examples include neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis complex, von Hippel-Lindau disease, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These syndromes often involve mutations in tumor suppressor genes, which normally help regulate cell growth and prevent uncontrolled division.
* **Family History:**  While most CNS tumors are not directly inherited, having a family history of brain tumors, particularly gliomas, may slightly increase an individual's risk. This may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors.

**2. Environmental Exposures:**

* **Ionizing Radiation:** Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as from radiation therapy for other cancers (especially in childhood), is a well-established risk factor for certain types of CNS tumors, particularly meningiomas and gliomas.  Diagnostic imaging, like X-rays and CT scans, involve much lower doses and the associated risk, while present, is considered very small.
* **Occupational Exposures:** Some studies suggest potential links between certain occupational exposures (e.g., vinyl chloride, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields) and an increased risk of CNS tumors, but the evidence is generally less conclusive and requires further research.

**3. Other Potential Factors:**

* **Immune System Dysfunction:**  Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients, may have a slightly increased risk of certain types of CNS tumors, particularly lymphomas.
* **Cellular Phones:**  Extensive research has not established a clear link between cell phone use and brain tumors.  The majority of studies have not found an increased risk, although some studies have suggested a possible association with long-term, heavy use. This remains an area of ongoing research.
* **Head Injury:** Some studies have explored a possible link between severe head injury and meningioma risk, but the evidence is not conclusive.

**4. Unknown Factors:**

The majority of adult CNS tumors have no identifiable cause.  Ongoing research continues to investigate genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to their development.

**In summary:** While we know some risk factors, the cause of most adult CNS tumors remains elusive.  It's crucial to discuss any concerns with a medical professional, especially if you experience neurological symptoms or have a family history of CNS tumors. They can provide personalized advice and recommend appropriate screening or diagnostic tests if necessary.",0.7301,0.048,0.0219,0.0437,12.548
What are the treatments for Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy ?,"How might pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy be treated? Anticonvulsant drugs, which are usually given to control seizures, are ineffective in people with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Instead, people with this type of seizure are medically treated with large daily doses of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B6 found in food). Recent studies have focused on using a lysine-restricted diet in addition to pyridoxine. Preliminary results suggest that this treatment has the potential to help control seizures and improve developmental outcomes in children with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy.","The primary treatment for pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) is high-dose pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.  Standard anticonvulsant medications are generally ineffective.

While lifelong pyridoxine supplementation is the cornerstone of PDE management, recent research suggests potential benefits from adjunctive therapies, particularly dietary restrictions:

* **Pyridoxine:**  This is the first-line and essential treatment.  Dosing is individualized and often requires high doses, significantly exceeding the recommended daily allowance.  Treatment is lifelong.

* **Lysine-restricted diet:** Emerging evidence suggests that restricting dietary lysine, an amino acid, may improve seizure control and developmental outcomes in some individuals with PDE, particularly those with mutations affecting the antiquitin (ALDH7A1) enzyme. This dietary approach is typically used in conjunction with pyridoxine supplementation, not as a replacement.  Further research is needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.


It's important to note that PDE requires specialized management by a medical team experienced with this rare condition. This team may include neurologists, geneticists, dieticians, and other healthcare professionals.  Treatment plans are individualized based on the patient's specific genetic variant and clinical presentation.",0.7595,0.332,0.07,0.1544,7.487
What are the genetic changes related to spastic paraplegia type 4 ?,"Mutations in the SPAST gene cause spastic paraplegia type 4. The SPAST gene provides instructions for producing a protein called spastin. Spastin is found throughout the body, particularly in certain nerve cells (neurons). The spastin protein plays a role in the function of microtubules, which are rigid, hollow fibers that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). Microtubules are also involved in transporting cell components and facilitating cell division. Spastin likely helps restrict microtubule length and disassemble microtubule structures when they are no longer needed. Mutations in spastin impair the microtubules' ability to transport cell components, especially in nerve cells; researchers believe this contributes to the major signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 4.","The primary genetic change associated with Spastic Paraplegia type 4 (SPG4) is a mutation in the *SPAST* gene (also known as *SPG4* gene), located on chromosome 2p22.3.  The vast majority of these mutations are heterozygous, meaning only one copy of the gene is affected.

While over 300 different mutations in *SPAST* have been identified, they can be broadly categorized as:

* **Loss-of-function mutations:** These are the most common type and represent approximately 80% of SPG4 cases.  They lead to a reduction or complete absence of functional spastin protein. These mutations include:
    * **Nonsense mutations:** Introduce a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated, non-functional protein.
    * **Frameshift mutations:** Insertions or deletions of DNA bases that shift the reading frame of the gene, leading to a drastically altered and non-functional protein.
    * **Splice site mutations:** Disrupt the normal splicing process of the *SPAST* gene's mRNA, often resulting in a non-functional protein.
    * **Large deletions:** Removal of a significant portion of the *SPAST* gene.

* **Dominant-negative mutations:**  Less common than loss-of-function mutations, these mutations result in a mutated spastin protein that interferes with the function of the remaining normal spastin protein produced from the unaffected copy of the gene.  Missense mutations (single base changes leading to a different amino acid) can sometimes have a dominant-negative effect.

The specific type and location of the mutation within the *SPAST* gene can sometimes (but not always) influence the age of onset and severity of SPG4 symptoms. However, there is considerable phenotypic variability even within families with the same mutation, suggesting that other genetic and environmental factors also play a role in disease manifestation.


It's important to note that while *SPAST* mutations account for the majority of SPG4 cases, other genes can also cause similar spastic paraplegia phenotypes, classified as other SPG types.  Genetic testing is crucial for accurate diagnosis.

What are the treatments for Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome ?,"Treatment is symptomatic and may include medication therapies with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling, as well as antibiotics and immunosuppressants. Surgery may be recommended to relieve pressure on the facial nerves and to reduce swollen tissue, but its effectiveness has not been established. Massage and electrical stimulation may also be prescribed.","Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome (MRS) treatment focuses on managing symptoms, as there is no cure.  The provided context accurately summarizes the main approaches:

**1. Medication:**

* **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):**  These are often the first line of treatment to reduce inflammation and pain associated with the swelling (especially orofacial granulomatosis).
* **Corticosteroids:**  These potent anti-inflammatory drugs can be administered systemically (orally or intravenously) or topically (creams or injections) for more severe swelling or when NSAIDs are insufficient.  However, long-term systemic use should be avoided due to potential side effects.  Intralesional injections can be particularly effective for localized granulomas.
* **Antibiotics:**  While MRS is not primarily an infectious disease, antibiotics like tetracycline (minocycline) have shown some benefit in treating orofacial granulomatosis, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory properties.  (e.g.,  Sciubba JJ, Said-Al-Naief N.  The role of antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of orofacial granulomatosis.  Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 2003;95(3):292-297.)
* **Immunosuppressants:**  In cases resistant to other treatments, immunosuppressants like azathioprine or methotrexate may be considered to modulate the immune system, which is thought to play a role in MRS.  However, these drugs carry significant potential side effects and require careful monitoring.

**2. Non-Pharmacological Therapies:**

* **Surgery:**  Surgical decompression of the facial nerve might be considered in cases of severe facial paralysis, but its effectiveness is not well-established and recurrence is possible.  Cheiloplasty (lip surgery) can be used to address persistent lip swelling, but it's primarily for cosmetic improvement.
* **Massage and Electrical Stimulation:** These therapies may offer some benefit in managing facial paralysis, but evidence supporting their widespread use is limited.

**3. Other Considerations:**

* **Symptom-Specific Treatment:**  Other symptoms like headache may be managed with appropriate medications (e.g., analgesics).
* **Trigger Avoidance:**  Identifying and avoiding potential triggers (e.g., certain foods or allergens) may help reduce symptom flares.

**Important Note:**  The optimal treatment approach for MRS varies depending on the individual's specific symptoms and their severity.  A multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists, dermatologists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons, and other specialists is often necessary to provide comprehensive care.  Patients should consult with their healthcare providers to determine the best course of treatment.",0.6898,0.2062,0.0627,0.1391,12.8309
What are the symptoms of Hair defect with photosensitivity and mental retardation ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Hair defect with photosensitivity and mental retardation? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Hair defect with photosensitivity and mental retardation. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormal hair quantity 90% Coarse hair 90% Cognitive impairment 90% Cutaneous photosensitivity 90% Fine hair 90% Pili torti 90% Abnormality of immune system physiology 50% Autosomal recessive inheritance - Brittle hair - Intellectual disability - Sparse eyebrow - Sparse eyelashes - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","The signs and symptoms of Hair defect with photosensitivity and mental retardation, as provided by the Human Phenotype Ontology and contextual information, include:

**Highly Prevalent (around 90%):**

* **Abnormal hair quantity:** This can manifest as either excessively sparse hair or unusually thick hair.
* **Coarse hair:** Hair shafts are thicker and rougher than normal.
* **Cognitive impairment:**  Reduced intellectual functioning affecting learning, memory, and problem-solving.
* **Cutaneous photosensitivity:**  Increased sensitivity to sunlight, leading to skin reactions like sunburn, rashes, or blistering upon exposure.
* **Fine hair:**  Hair shafts are thinner and more delicate than usual.  This seemingly contradicts ""coarse hair"" but both are listed as occurring in 90% of patients, suggesting potential variability in presentation.  Some individuals might have a mix of fine and coarse hair or changes over time.
* **Pili torti:**  A hair shaft abnormality where the hair is twisted along its axis, making it brittle and prone to breakage.


**Moderately Prevalent (around 50%):**

* **Abnormality of immune system physiology:** This broad term indicates a dysfunction in the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections or autoimmune disorders.  Further details on the specific immune defects are not provided in the context.

**Other Features (frequency unspecified):**

* **Autosomal recessive inheritance:**  This refers to the genetic inheritance pattern of the condition, not a symptom itself. It means both parents must carry the mutated gene for a child to be affected.
* **Brittle hair:**  Hair that breaks easily. This likely relates to the pili torti.
* **Intellectual disability:**  Significant limitations in both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior.  This overlaps with ""cognitive impairment.""
* **Sparse eyebrow:**  Thin or absent eyebrow hair.
* **Sparse eyelashes:**  Thin or absent eyelashes.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Variability:** The provided percentages are estimates based on limited studies.  The actual prevalence of each symptom may vary.  Individuals with the same condition can present with different combinations and severities of symptoms.
* **Diagnosis:** This information is not sufficient for diagnosis.  A proper diagnosis requires a comprehensive medical evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional, including genetic testing.
* **Further Research:**  While the Human Phenotype Ontology and Orphanet are valuable resources, consulting peer-reviewed medical literature and clinical experts is crucial for a deeper understanding of this rare condition.",0.8342,0.4295,0.135,0.2083,12.307
How to diagnose Sickle Cell Disease ?,"Screening Tests
                
People who do not know whether they make sickle hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) or another abnormal hemoglobin (such as C,  thalassemia, E) can find out by having their blood tested. This way, they can learn whether they carry a gene (i.e., have the trait) for an abnormal hemoglobin that they could pass on to a child.
                
When each parent has this information, he or she can be better informed about the chances of having a child with some type of sickle cell disease (SCD), such as hemoglobin SS, SC, S thalassemia, or others.
                
Newborn Screening
                
When a child has SCD, it is very important to diagnose it early to better prevent complications.
                
Every state in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories require that every baby is tested for SCD as part of a newborn screening program.
                
In newborn screening programs, blood from a heel prick is collected in spots on a special paper. The hemoglobin from this blood is then analyzed in special labs.
                
Newborn screening results are sent to the doctor who ordered the test and to the childs primary doctor.
                
If a baby is found to have SCD, health providers from a special follow-up newborn screening group contact the family directly to make sure that the parents know the results. The child is always retested to be sure that the diagnosis is correct.
                
Newborn screening programs also find out whether the baby has an abnormal hemoglobin trait. If so, parents are informed, and counseling is offered.
                
Remember that when a child has sickle cell trait or SCD, a future sibling, or the childs own future child, may be at risk. These possibilities should be discussed with the primary care doctor, a blood specialist called a hematologist, and/or a genetics counselor.
                
Prenatal Screening
                
Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. This is done using a sample of amniotic fluid, the liquid in the sac surrounding a growing embryo, or tissue taken from the placenta, the organ that attaches the umbilical cord to the mothers womb.
                
Testing before birth can be done as early as 810 weeks into the pregnancy. This testing looks for the sickle hemoglobin gene rather than the abnormal hemoglobin.","Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) diagnosis can occur at several stages of life, utilizing different methods:

**1. Newborn Screening:**

* **Method:** Heel prick blood sample collected on special filter paper.
* **Analysis:**  Hemoglobin analysis in specialized labs detects the presence of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and other abnormal hemoglobins.
* **Timing:** Mandated in all US states, District of Columbia, and US territories shortly after birth.
* **Follow-up:** Positive results are confirmed with repeat testing. Families are contacted by specialized follow-up programs to provide information and support.  Genetic counseling may be offered.

**2. Prenatal Screening:**

* **Method:**  Analysis of amniotic fluid or placental tissue.
* **Analysis:**  Detects the presence of the sickle cell gene.
* **Timing:**  Can be performed as early as 8-10 weeks of gestation.
* **Purpose:** Allows for early diagnosis and parental counseling regarding potential implications for the child.

**3. Postnatal/General Population Screening:**

* **Method:** Blood test (e.g., hemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]).
* **Analysis:** Identifies the presence and type of abnormal hemoglobin, including HbS, HbC, and thalassemias.
* **Purpose:** Used for individuals who were not screened at birth, those with family history of SCD, or those exhibiting symptoms suggestive of SCD. This method also identifies sickle cell trait (carrying one copy of the sickle cell gene).

It's important to note that while newborn screening programs are highly effective, they are not foolproof.  False negatives can occur, particularly in cases of infants with co-existing conditions like severe anemia.  Therefore, maintaining awareness of potential SCD symptoms and seeking medical evaluation if concerns arise is crucial, even if a newborn screen was negative.",0.8111,0.3691,0.0981,0.1483,10.2838
Is protein S deficiency inherited ?,"Protein S deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one altered copy of the PROS1 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause mild protein S deficiency. Individuals who inherit two altered copies of this gene in each cell have severe protein S deficiency.","Yes, protein S deficiency is inherited.  As stated in the provided context, it follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This means that only one copy of the mutated *PROS1* gene is sufficient to cause mild protein S deficiency.

What is (are) VACTERL association ?,"VACTERL association is a non-random association of birth defects that affects multiple parts of the body. The term VACTERL is an acronym with each letter representing the first letter of one of the more common findings seen in affected individuals: (V) = vertebral abnormalities; (A) = anal atresia; (C) = cardiac (heart) defects; (T) = tracheal anomalies including tracheoesophageal (TE) fistula; (E) = esophageal atresia; (R) = renal (kidney) and radial (thumb side of hand) abnormalities; and (L) = other limb abnormalities. Other features may include (less frequently) growth deficiencies and failure to thrive; facial asymmetry (hemifacial microsomia); external ear malformations; intestinal malrotation; and genital anomalies. Intelligence is usually normal. The exact cause of VACTERL association is unknown; most cases occur randomly, for no apparent reason. In rare cases, VACTERL association has occurred in more than one family member.","VACTERL association is a non-random clustering of congenital malformations.  It is not a single disorder but rather the presence of at least three of the following component features:

* **V**ertebral anomalies: These can include hemivertebrae (incomplete formation of a vertebra), fused vertebrae, or extra vertebrae.
* **A**nal atresia:  The anal opening is absent or misplaced.
* **C**ardiac defects:  A wide range of heart defects can occur, such as ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, tetralogy of Fallot, and others.
* **T**racheo-Esophageal fistula: An abnormal connection between the trachea (windpipe) and the esophagus. This is often accompanied by esophageal atresia.
* **E**sophageal atresia: The esophagus, the tube connecting the mouth and stomach, does not develop properly.
* **R**enal anomalies:  Kidney malformations, such as absent or horseshoe kidney, can occur.  Radial anomalies refer to defects of the radius bone in the forearm, often resulting in thumb abnormalities or a missing thumb.
* **L**imb defects: Primarily affecting the radial side of the upper limbs, but other limb abnormalities can also be present.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Diagnosis:** VACTERL association is diagnosed clinically based on the presence of at least three of the characteristic features. Genetic testing is sometimes used to rule out other syndromes, but there's no single genetic test for VACTERL itself.
* **Cause:** The exact cause of VACTERL association is largely unknown.  It's generally considered sporadic, meaning it occurs randomly. Genetic and environmental factors are suspected to play a role, but more research is needed.  While some familial cases have been reported, these are rare.
* **Prognosis:** The prognosis for individuals with VACTERL association varies depending on the specific defects present and their severity. Early diagnosis and appropriate medical and surgical interventions are crucial for improving outcomes.
* **Management:** Management of VACTERL association involves a multidisciplinary approach, often requiring specialists in surgery, cardiology, urology, orthopedics, and other fields.  Treatment is tailored to the individual's specific needs and may involve surgical repair of birth defects, supportive care, and long-term monitoring.

**Further Information:**  Organizations like the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offer valuable resources for families and individuals affected by VACTERL association.

"What are the treatments for Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1 ?","How might Blepharophimosis syndrome type 1 be treated? Management of blepharophimosis syndrome type 1 requires the input of several specialists including a clinical geneticist, pediatric ophthalmologist, eye plastic (oculoplastic) surgeon, endocrinologist, reproductive endocrinologist, and gynecologist. Eyelid surgery should be discussed with an oculoplastic surgeon to decide on the method and timing that is best suited for the patient. Traditionally, surgical correction of the blepharophimosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus (canthoplasty) is performed at ages three to five years, followed about a year later by ptosis correction (usually requiring a brow suspension procedure). If the epicanthal folds are small, a ""Y-V canthoplasty"" is traditionally used; if the epicanthal folds are severe, a ""double Z-plasty"" is used. Unpublished reports have indicated that advanced understanding of the lower eyelid position has allowed for more targeted surgery that results in a more natural appearance.

There is no specific treatment for POF caused by blepharophimosis syndrome type 1. Hormone replacement therapy is generally estrogen and progesterone and sometimes also includes testosterone. Birth control pills are sometimes substituted for hormone replacement therapy. Although health care providers can suggest treatments for some of the symptoms of POF, currently there is no scientifically established treatment to restore fertility for women diagnosed with POF. Women with POF are encouraged to speak to a health care professional. If you wish to obtain more information and support, you can visit the International Premature Ovarian Failure Association.","Treatment for Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome type 1 (BPES type 1) focuses primarily on the eyelid abnormalities and the associated premature ovarian failure (POF).

**1. Eyelid Abnormalities (Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus):**

* **Surgical Correction:** This is the primary treatment for the eyelid defects.  The timing and specific procedures are individualized based on the severity of the abnormalities and the child's development.
    * **Canthoplasty:** Addresses the telecanthus (widely spaced inner corners of the eyes) and epicanthus inversus (folds of skin covering the inner corner of the eyes).  Y-V canthoplasty is used for milder cases, while double Z-plasty is used for more severe cases.
    * **Ptosis Correction (Brow Suspension):**  Addresses the drooping upper eyelid (ptosis). This is typically performed after canthoplasty, often around age 4-6.  Brow suspension is a common technique, where the eyelid is attached to the brow muscles to lift it.

* **Timing of Surgery:** Traditionally, canthoplasty is performed between ages 3-5, followed by ptosis correction a year later.  However, newer surgical techniques and understanding of lower eyelid positioning may allow for earlier and more targeted interventions.  An oculoplastic surgeon specializing in these procedures should be consulted to determine the optimal approach.

**2. Premature Ovarian Failure (POF):**

* **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** This is the standard treatment for POF, regardless of the cause.  HRT aims to replace the missing estrogen and often includes progesterone. Testosterone may also be added in some cases.  The goal is to manage the symptoms of estrogen deficiency (e.g., hot flashes, vaginal dryness, bone loss) and maintain overall health.
* **Birth Control Pills:**  These can sometimes be used as an alternative to HRT, especially in younger women.
* **Fertility:**  Currently, there is no established treatment to restore fertility in women with POF caused by BPES type 1.  While HRT can manage the symptoms of POF, it does not restore ovarian function.  Women with BPES type 1 and POF should consult with a reproductive endocrinologist to discuss family planning options, which may include assisted reproductive technologies using donor eggs.

**3. Multidisciplinary Management:**

It's crucial to emphasize that BPES type 1 requires a multidisciplinary approach involving:

* **Clinical Geneticist:**  For diagnosis, genetic counseling, and family planning advice.
* **Pediatric Ophthalmologist:**  For monitoring eye health and development.
* **Oculoplastic Surgeon:**  For surgical correction of eyelid abnormalities.
* **Endocrinologist:**  For managing POF and hormone replacement therapy.
* **Reproductive Endocrinologist/Gynecologist:**  For reproductive health counseling and management of POF.

This coordinated approach ensures comprehensive care addressing both the ophthalmologic and endocrine aspects of BPES type 1.",0.6164,0.5064,0.1997,0.2276,13.8917

Management focuses on alleviating symptoms, managing complications, and providing supportive care.  This can include:

* **Management of Stroke Risk Factors:**  As CARASIL increases the risk of strokes, managing modifiable risk factors is crucial. This includes controlling hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes through lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) and medications if necessary. Smoking cessation is also strongly advised.
* **Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation:**  Physical therapy can help individuals maintain or improve mobility and function affected by strokes or other neurological symptoms.  Occupational therapy can assist with daily living activities.
* **Symptomatic Treatment:**  Medications may be prescribed to manage specific symptoms like pain, spasticity, or mood disturbances.
* **Genetic Counseling:**  Genetic counseling is recommended for individuals with CARASIL and their families to understand the inheritance pattern, risks to other family members, and available testing options.
* **Regular Monitoring:** Regular check-ups with a neurologist are important to monitor disease progression, manage complications, and adjust treatment strategies as needed.

**Future Research Directions:**

Research is ongoing to explore potential disease-modifying therapies for CARASIL.  Given the role of *HTRA1* gene mutations in the disease, research focusing on this gene and its protein product may lead to targeted therapies in the future.

What is (are) Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors ?,"Key Points
                    - Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract.    - Genetic factors can increase the risk of having a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.     - Signs of gastrointestinal stromal tumors include blood in the stool or vomit.    - Tests that examine the GI tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastrointestinal stromal tumors.    - Very small GISTs are common.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract.
                    The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the bodys digestive system. It helps to digest food and takes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food so they can be used by the body. The GI tract is made up of the following organs:         -  Stomach.    -  Small intestine.    -  Large intestine (colon).         Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) may be malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer). They are most common in the stomach and small intestine but may be found anywhere in or near the GI tract. Some scientists believe that GISTs begin in cells called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), in the wall of the GI tract.      See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for information on the treatment of GIST in children.
                
                 
                    Very small GISTs are common.
                    Sometimes GISTs are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil. Tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason, such as an x-ray or surgery. Some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body. Doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow.","Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) are tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) within the walls of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.  The GI tract is part of the digestive system and includes the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine (colon). While GISTs can occur anywhere along the GI tract or in nearby tissues, they are most commonly found in the stomach and small intestine.

Key characteristics of GISTs:

* **Origin:**  They originate from the ICCs, which are specialized cells that regulate the rhythmic contractions of the GI tract.
* **Malignant potential:** GISTs can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).  
* **Size variability:** GISTs can range in size from very small (less than a pencil eraser) to quite large.  Very small GISTs are relatively common and often discovered incidentally during unrelated medical procedures.  The management of these small, asymptomatic GISTs is a subject of ongoing discussion among medical professionals, with some advocating for watchful waiting and others recommending removal.
* **Symptoms:**  Larger GISTs can cause symptoms such as blood in the stool or vomit.
* **Genetics:** Genetic factors can increase the risk of developing a GIST.
* **Diagnosis:**  Diagnostic tests used to detect and evaluate GISTs include imaging studies of the GI tract, such as CT scans and endoscopic ultrasound, as well as biopsies for pathological analysis.
* **Prognosis and treatment:**  The prognosis and treatment options for GISTs are influenced by several factors, including tumor size, location, mitotic rate (how quickly the tumor cells are dividing), and the presence of metastasis (spread to other parts of the body).


It's important to note that the provided context mentions information from the PDQ® summary on Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment regarding GISTs in children.

Is Situs inversus inherited ?,"Is situs inversus inherited? The genetics of situs inversus is complex. Several familial cases have been reported in which the inheritance has been described as either autosomal recessive (most commonly), autosomal dominant, or X-linked. The condition appears to be genetically heterogeneous, meaning that different genetic factors or genes may cause the condition among different people or families. If situs inversus is associated with another underlying syndrome or condition, the inheritance pattern may be the same as that of the underlying condition. People with questions about genetic risks to themselves or family members are encouraged to speak with a genetics professional.","Situs inversus can be inherited, but the genetics are complex and not fully understood.  While most cases appear to be sporadic (occurring without a family history), familial cases have been documented.  The inheritance patterns observed in these families suggest genetic heterogeneity, meaning different genes or inheritance mechanisms can be involved.  These observed patterns include:

* **Autosomal recessive:** This is considered the most common inheritance pattern for familial situs inversus.  This means two copies of an abnormal gene must be present for the condition to develop.
* **Autosomal dominant:** In this pattern, only one copy of an abnormal gene is necessary for the condition to develop.
* **X-linked:**  In this pattern, the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome.

It's important to note that if situs inversus occurs as part of a syndrome (such as Kartagener syndrome), the inheritance pattern will follow that of the underlying syndrome.

Individuals concerned about the inheritance of situs inversus should consult with a genetics professional. They can assess family history, provide accurate risk assessments, and discuss available testing options.",0.8009,0.4604,0.1812,0.2806,6.2391
What are the treatments for Common variable immunodeficiency ?,"How might common variable immunodeficiency be treated?  The main treatment for common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is Ig replacement therapy, which stops the cycle of recurrent infections. Ig may be taken intravenously (through the vein) or subcutaneously (by injection). Adverse reactions to Ig must be monitored during therapy. Ig therapy is effective in most people, leading to less frequent infections and arthritic symptoms. However, gastrointestinal (digestive) symptoms have little improvement with IVIG. In some people wwith CVID and severe autoimmune disease, steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs in addition to Ig therapy may be needed. Detailed information about the management of CVID can be viewed on Medscape Reference's Web site.","The primary treatment for Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) is **immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement therapy**.  This therapy aims to replenish the missing or deficient antibodies, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of infections.

Ig replacement therapy can be administered in two ways:

* **Intravenously (IVIG):**  Delivered directly into a vein.
* **Subcutaneously (SCIG):** Injected under the skin.

**Monitoring for Adverse Reactions:**  It's crucial to monitor patients receiving Ig therapy for potential adverse reactions, although these are generally rare.

**Efficacy:** Ig replacement therapy is generally effective in reducing infections and improving arthritis-related symptoms in most individuals with CVID. However, it may not significantly improve gastrointestinal symptoms.

**Additional Treatments:**  For some individuals with CVID who also experience severe autoimmune complications, additional treatments may be necessary. These can include:

* **Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone):**  These powerful anti-inflammatory drugs can help suppress the overactive immune system.
* **Other Immunosuppressive Drugs:**  These medications further dampen the immune response and can be used when steroids are insufficient.

PDF Version (PDF, 40 KB)","The question asks about diagnosing diabetes using diabetes care records, but the provided text describes components of *managing* and *monitoring* diabetes, not diagnosing it.  Diagnosing diabetes requires specific tests and criteria interpreted by a healthcare professional.  The provided text outlines recommended tests and monitoring frequencies for individuals *already diagnosed* with diabetes.

To clarify, diagnosing diabetes involves one of the following tests:

* **A1C test:**  An A1C of 6.5% or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.
* **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) test:** A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests indicates diabetes.
* **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher two hours after consuming a sugary drink indicates diabetes.
* **Random Plasma Glucose (RPG):**  A random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, along with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia (increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss), can also be used to diagnose diabetes.

The records provided are valuable for *monitoring* diabetes management and assessing the effectiveness of treatment.  They help track:

* **Blood sugar control (A1C):**  Shows average blood sugar levels over 2-3 months.
* **Cardiovascular risk (Blood lipid tests):**  Monitors cholesterol and triglyceride levels to assess heart disease risk.
* **Kidney health (Kidney function tests):** Checks for kidney damage, a common complication of diabetes.
* **Eye health (Dilated eye exam):**  Screens for diabetic retinopathy, another potential complication.
* **Oral health (Dental exam):**  People with diabetes are at higher risk for gum disease.
* **Vaccination status:**  Important for preventing infections, which can be more serious in people with diabetes.


Therefore, the provided records are not used for diagnosis but are crucial for ongoing management of diabetes after a diagnosis has been made by a physician.

How to diagnose Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors ?,"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood CNS embryonal tumors or pineoblastomas. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a patient's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain and spinal cord with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan to look at the chemicals in brain tissue.     -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
                    A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma. If doctors think your child may have a CNS embryonal tumor or pineoblastoma, a biopsy may be done. For brain tumors, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes, a computer-guided needle is used to remove the tissue sample. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.    The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors.","Diagnosing childhood central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors, including pineoblastomas, involves a combination of clinical evaluation and specialized tests to confirm the presence and type of tumor.  Here's a breakdown of the diagnostic process:

**1. Initial Assessment:**

* **Physical Exam and History:** This provides a general overview of the child's health, looking for any unusual signs or symptoms, including neurological issues.  The child's medical history, including past illnesses and family history, is also crucial.
* **Neurological Exam:** This assesses the function of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It evaluates mental status, coordination, motor skills, reflexes, and sensory perception.  Specific deficits can suggest the location and potential impact of a tumor.

**2. Imaging Studies:**

* **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the Brain and Spinal Cord with Gadolinium:** MRI is the primary imaging modality for CNS tumors.  Gadolinium, a contrast agent, enhances the visibility of tumors by highlighting areas with increased vascularity or breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, often characteristic of tumors.  
* **Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS):**  This specialized MRI technique can provide information about the chemical composition of the brain tissue, helping to differentiate between different types of tumors.

**3. Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis:**

* **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):**  This procedure collects cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis.  The presence of tumor cells in the CSF, along with abnormal protein and glucose levels, can suggest the presence of a CNS tumor, although it's not always definitive.  It's important to note that lumbar puncture may be contraindicated in certain cases due to the risk of herniation if there is significant intracranial pressure.

**4. Tissue Biopsy:**

* **Biopsy:**  This is the definitive diagnostic procedure for CNS embryonal tumors. A small tissue sample is surgically removed from the suspected tumor site.  Different biopsy techniques may be used, including needle biopsy or open biopsy (craniotomy).  A computer-guided stereotactic biopsy can increase precision and minimize invasiveness.

**5. Pathological Examination:**

* **Histopathological Analysis:** A pathologist examines the biopsied tissue under a microscope to identify the presence and type of cancer cells. This includes evaluating the cellular characteristics, architecture, and grading of the tumor.
* **Immunohistochemistry:** This technique uses antibodies to detect specific antigens (proteins) on the surface of tumor cells.  This helps classify the tumor further and can be crucial in distinguishing between different types of embryonal tumors, including pineoblastomas.  Specific markers can help guide treatment decisions.

**Important Considerations:**

* The specific diagnostic approach may vary depending on the child's age, symptoms, and suspected tumor location.
* Early diagnosis and accurate classification are essential for determining the appropriate treatment strategy for childhood CNS embryonal tumors.
* A multidisciplinary team of specialists, including pediatric oncologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, and pathologists, is typically involved in the diagnosis and management of these tumors.

What is (are) Light chain deposition disease ?,"Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) involves the immune system, the body's system of protecting ourselves against infection. The body fights infection with antibodies. Antibodies are made up of small protein segments called light chains and heavy chains. People with LCDD make  too many light chains which get deposited in many different tissues and organs of the body. While LCDD can occur in any organ, the kidneys are always involved. Deposits of light chains can also occur in the liver, heart, small intestine, spleen, skin, nervous system and bone marrow. Additionally, about 50-60% of patients with LCDD have multiple myeloma and 17% have a disease called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Early signs and symptoms of light chain deposition disease may include protein in the urine, high blood pressure, decreased kidney function, and nephrotic syndrome. The goal of treatment in patients with LCDD is to stop/decrease the production of light chains and damage to organs. Treatment options can include: autologous stem cell transplantation; a drug called Bortezomib; a class of drugs called immunomodulatory drugs; and kidney transplant.","Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a systemic disorder characterized by the overproduction and deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains (either kappa or lambda) in various tissues and organs, predominantly the kidneys.  These light chains are misfolded and prone to aggregation, disrupting normal organ function.  While the kidneys are universally affected, deposits can also occur in the liver, heart, small intestine, spleen, skin, nervous system, and bone marrow.

LCDD is related to other plasma cell dyscrasias, conditions in which abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal antibodies.  A significant proportion of LCDD patients also have multiple myeloma (50-60%) or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (17%).  These conditions share the underlying issue of abnormal plasma cell activity.

The clinical presentation of LCDD varies depending on the organs involved.  Early signs and symptoms often include:

* **Proteinuria:** Excess protein in the urine, often a first sign of kidney damage.
* **Hypertension:** High blood pressure, likely due to kidney dysfunction.
* **Decreased Kidney Function:**  Progressive decline in kidney filtration capacity.
* **Nephrotic Syndrome:** A collection of symptoms including proteinuria, low blood protein levels, high cholesterol, and swelling (edema).

The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the production of the abnormal light chains and mitigate organ damage.  Treatment strategies often include:

* **Chemotherapy:**  Similar regimens used in multiple myeloma, aiming to suppress the abnormal plasma cells.  This often includes:
    * **Bortezomib (Velcade):** A proteasome inhibitor.
    * **Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs):**  Such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide.
* **Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT):**  High-dose chemotherapy followed by infusion of the patient's own stem cells to rescue bone marrow function.  This is often considered for eligible patients.
* **Kidney Transplantation:**  May be necessary in cases of end-stage renal disease.

It's important to note that LCDD is a complex disorder, and treatment decisions are individualized based on the patient's specific presentation, disease stage, and overall health.

What are the symptoms of Dystonia 8 ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Dystonia 8? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Dystonia 8. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Childhood onset - Dysarthria - Dysphagia - Facial grimacing - Infantile onset - Myokymia - Paroxysmal choreoathetosis - Paroxysmal dystonia - Torticollis - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common.","Dystonia 8, also known as DYT8, is characterized by the following signs and symptoms, as provided by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO):

* **Autosomal dominant inheritance:** This refers to the inheritance pattern, not a symptom itself. It means the gene responsible for DYT8 is located on a non-sex chromosome and only one copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the condition.
* **Childhood onset/Infantile onset:**  These specify the typical age of symptom onset, ranging from infancy to childhood.  The specific age of onset can vary.
* **Dysarthria:** Difficulty with speech articulation due to impaired muscle control.
* **Dysphagia:** Difficulty swallowing.
* **Facial grimacing:** Involuntary facial muscle contractions resulting in distorted facial expressions.
* **Myokymia:** Continuous, involuntary muscle twitching, often subtle and worm-like.
* **Paroxysmal choreoathetosis:**  Episodic, involuntary movements characterized by a combination of chorea (jerky, unpredictable movements) and athetosis (slow, writhing movements).
* **Paroxysmal dystonia:**  Sudden, involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal postures or twisting movements that come and go in episodes.
* **Torticollis:** A specific type of dystonia affecting the neck muscles, causing the head to tilt or turn to one side.

What are the treatments for Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta ?,"How might pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta be treated? Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) often resolves on its own within several weeks to several months. Depending on the severity of the condition and the symptoms present, treatment may not be necessary. If treatment is indicated, there are many different therapies that have been used to treat PLEVA with varying degrees of success. These include: Oral antibiotics Sun exposure Topical steroids Immunomodulators (medications used to help regulate or normalize the immune system) Phototherapy Systemic steroids Unfortunately, PLEVA may not always respond to treatment and relapses often occur when treatment is discontinued.","Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) often resolves spontaneously, so treatment isn't always necessary.  When treatment *is* indicated, it aims to control symptoms and shorten the duration of outbreaks.  There's no single universally effective treatment, and the approach often depends on the severity of the condition.  Options include:

* **Watchful Waiting/Observation:** For mild cases, simply monitoring the condition without active intervention may be sufficient.  This is especially true given the self-limiting nature of many PLEVA cases.

* **Topical Corticosteroids:** These are often the first-line treatment for localized and less severe cases. They help reduce inflammation and itching. Examples include creams or ointments containing betamethasone or clobetasol.

* **Oral Antibiotics:**  Erythromycin and tetracycline antibiotics are sometimes used, particularly when a bacterial trigger is suspected, although the exact mechanism of action in PLEVA is unclear.

* **Narrowband UVB Phototherapy:** This involves controlled exposure to specific wavelengths of ultraviolet light, which can help suppress inflammation and promote healing.

* **Psoralen plus Ultraviolet A (PUVA) Photochemotherapy:**  Less commonly used than narrowband UVB, PUVA involves taking a photosensitizing medication (psoralen) followed by exposure to UVA light. This can be effective but carries a higher risk of long-term side effects like skin aging and an increased risk of skin cancer.

* **Systemic Corticosteroids (e.g., Prednisone):**  Reserved for severe cases that don't respond to other treatments.  Due to potential side effects with prolonged use, systemic corticosteroids are generally used for short periods.

* **Immunomodulators:**  Medications like methotrexate, azathioprine, or cyclosporine may be considered in recalcitrant or chronic cases. These medications suppress the immune system and can have significant side effects, requiring careful monitoring.

* **Other therapies:**  Less frequently used options include topical retinoids, topical tacrolimus, or dapsone.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relapse:** PLEVA is known for recurrence even after successful treatment.  Maintenance therapy may be necessary in some cases.
* **Individualized Treatment:**  The optimal treatment approach depends on the individual's specific presentation, severity, and response to therapy.  A dermatologist should be consulted for diagnosis and management.
* **Limited High-Quality Evidence:** While many treatments are employed, high-quality clinical trials comparing different PLEVA treatments are limited. Treatment decisions are often based on clinical experience and case series.


It's crucial to consult with a dermatologist for accurate diagnosis and a personalized treatment plan. They can assess the severity of your condition and recommend the most appropriate course of action.  Self-treating should be avoided.",0.8715,0.2707,0.0974,0.1535,13.083
What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis ?,These resources address the diagnosis or management of rheumatoid arthritis:  - American College of Rheumatology: ACR-Endorsed Criteria for Rheumatic Diseases  - American College of Rheumatology: Treatment for Rheumatic Diseases  - Genetic Testing Registry: Rheumatoid arthritis   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment aims to reduce pain, minimize joint damage, and improve or maintain function.  Treatment strategies typically involve a combination of medications, lifestyle modifications, and sometimes surgery.  Here's a breakdown:

**Medications:**

* **Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs):** These are the cornerstone of RA treatment and work to slow the progression of the disease and prevent joint damage.  They are often started early in the disease course.  Examples include:
    * **Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs):** Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide.
    * **Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs):**  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab, sarilumab), Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g., tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib),  B-cell depleting agents (e.g., rituximab),  and others.
    * **Targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs):**  JAK inhibitors (as mentioned above).
* **Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** These medications (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) help reduce pain and inflammation but do not slow the progression of the disease.  They are often used for short-term symptom relief or in conjunction with DMARDs.
* **Corticosteroids:**  These potent anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., prednisone) can provide rapid relief of symptoms.  They are often used in short bursts or at a low dose to bridge the gap while waiting for DMARDs to take effect. Long-term use is generally avoided due to potential side effects.
* **Pain Relievers:**  Acetaminophen can be used for mild pain relief.  Opioids are generally not recommended for long-term pain management in RA due to the risk of addiction and other side effects.


**Non-Pharmacological Treatments:**

* **Physical Therapy:** Helps maintain joint range of motion, strengthen muscles, and improve function.
* **Occupational Therapy:** Focuses on adapting daily activities to make them easier to perform with limited joint function.
* **Assistive Devices:**  Canes, splints, and other devices can help support joints and improve mobility.
* **Lifestyle Modifications:** Regular exercise, weight management, and a balanced diet can help improve overall health and manage RA symptoms.
* **Patient Education and Support:** Understanding the disease and its management is crucial for optimal outcomes.  Support groups and patient education resources can provide valuable information and emotional support.


**Surgery:**

* **Joint Replacement Surgery:**  For severely damaged joints, surgery to replace the joint with an artificial one can significantly improve pain and function.
* **Synovectomy:**  Surgical removal of the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint) can help reduce pain and swelling.
* **Tendon Repair:**  Damaged tendons can be surgically repaired to improve function.


**Important Considerations:**

* Treatment decisions are individualized based on the severity of the disease, the patient's overall health, and their preferences.
* Regular monitoring is essential to assess treatment effectiveness and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
* Early and aggressive treatment is often recommended to prevent irreversible joint damage.

what's the symptomes of a heart attack ?,"Symptoms Can Vary Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies. The warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack aren't the same for everyone. Many heart attacks start slowly as mild pain or discomfort. Some people don't have symptoms at all. Heart attacks that occur without any symptoms or very mild symptoms are called silent heart attacks. However, some people may have a pattern of symptoms that recur. The more signs and symptoms you have, the more likely it is that you're having a heart attack If you have a second heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same as the first heart attack. Here are common signs and symptoms of a heart attack. Chest Pain or Discomfort The most common symptom of heart attack is chest pain or discomfort. Chest pain or discomfort that doesn't go away or changes from its usual pattern (for example, occurs more often or while you're resting) can be a sign of a heart attack. Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. The discomfort can feel like uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It can be mild or severe. Heart attack pain can sometimes feel like indigestion or heartburn. All chest pain should be checked by a doctor. Other Upper Body Discomfort Discomfort can also occur in other areas of the upper body, including pain or numbness in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach. Shortness of Breath Shortness of breath often happens along with, or before chest discomfort. Other Symptoms Other symptoms may include - breaking out in a cold sweat   - having nausea and vomiting   - feeling light-headed or dizzy   - fainting   - sleep problems   - fatigue   - lack of energy.  breaking out in a cold sweat having nausea and vomiting feeling light-headed or dizzy fainting sleep problems fatigue lack of energy. Angina or a Heart Attack? Angina is chest pain or discomfort that occurs if an area of your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Angina occurs in people who have coronary heart disease, usually when they're active. Angina symptoms can be very similar to heart attack symptoms. Angina pain usually lasts for only a few minutes and goes away with rest. If you think you may be having a heart attack, or if your angina pain does not go away as usual when you take your angina medication as directed, call 9-1-1 for help. You can begin to receive life saving treatment in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room.","Symptoms of a heart attack can vary and may not always present as the classic sudden, crushing chest pain.  Some people experience no symptoms at all (silent heart attack).  However, common signs and symptoms include:

* **Chest Pain or Discomfort:**  This is the most common symptom. It's often described as pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain in the center of the chest.  It can be mild or severe, and may last for more than a few minutes, go away and come back, or even resemble indigestion or heartburn. *Any* chest pain should be evaluated by a doctor.

* **Upper Body Discomfort:** Pain or numbness can radiate to one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw, or stomach.

    * Lightheadedness or dizziness
    * Fainting
    * Sleep problems
    * Fatigue/lack of energy


It's important to distinguish between a heart attack and angina. Angina is also chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, but it typically lasts only a few minutes and resolves with rest or angina medication.  If angina pain doesn't go away as usual or you suspect a heart attack, **call emergency medical services (e.g., 911 in the US) immediately.**  Timely treatment is crucial.",0.8155,0.5325,0.3294,0.3935,8.8068
what's a heart attack ?,"Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart through its coronary arteries. If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Affects Both Men and Women Heart attacks are a leading killer of both men and women in the United States. Each year, more than one million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. Half of those who die do so within one hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. These treatments can save lives and prevent disabilities. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance right away -- within 5 minutes -- if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. You also should call for help if your chest pain doesn't go away as it usually does when you take medicine prescribed for angina (chest pain). Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Emergency personnel in the ambulance can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. They carry drugs and equipment that can help your medical condition, including - oxygen   - aspirin to prevent further blood clotting   - heart medications, such as nitroglycerin   - pain relief treatments  - defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating.  oxygen aspirin to prevent further blood clotting heart medications, such as nitroglycerin pain relief treatments defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating. If blood flow in the blocked artery can be restored quickly, permanent heart damage may be prevented. Yet, many people do not seek medical care for 2 hours or more after symptoms start.","A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is abruptly cut off, most commonly due to a blockage in a coronary artery.  These arteries supply the heart muscle itself with oxygen-rich blood.  The blockage, typically a blood clot formed on a plaque of cholesterol and other substances, deprives the heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the affected heart muscle begins to die.  The longer the blockage persists without treatment, the greater the damage.  This can lead to permanent heart damage, disability, or death.

* **Heat exhaustion:**  Excessive exposure to heat can overwhelm the body's cooling mechanisms.
* **Cancers:** Certain cancers can cause fever.
* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues can also lead to fever.

Treatment for fever depends on the underlying cause.  For fevers caused by infection, rest and fluids are important.  Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) and ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin) can help reduce fever. Aspirin can be used by adults, but is generally avoided in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.  It's crucial to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids.  If the fever is persistent, high, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms, it's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.",0.702,0.4688,0.1373,0.2789,9.2245
what(s the fever,"A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. It is not an illness. It is part of your body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections do well at the body's normal temperature (98.6 F). A slight fever can make it harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.    Infections cause most fevers. There can be many other causes, including       -  Medicines    -  Heat exhaustion    -  Cancers    -  Autoimmune diseases       Treatment depends on the cause of your fever. Your health care provider may recommend using over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower a very high fever. Adults can also take aspirin, but children with fevers should not take aspirin. It is also important to drink enough liquids to prevent dehydration.","A fever is an elevation in body temperature above the normal range.  It's not an illness itself, but rather a symptom, and often a part of the body's natural defense mechanism against infection.  The body raises its temperature to create a less hospitable environment for many bacteria and viruses.  Fever also helps activate the immune system.

While infections are the most common cause of fever, other potential causes include:

* **Medications:** Some medications can cause drug-induced fever as a side effect.
* **Heat exhaustion:**  Overexposure to high temperatures can lead to heat exhaustion, which includes fever as a symptom.
* **Cancers:** Certain types of cancer can cause fever.
* **Autoimmune diseases:**  Conditions where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues can sometimes cause fever.

Treatment for a fever depends on the underlying cause.  If the fever is caused by an infection, treating the infection is key.  For high fevers, over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) or ibuprofen (e.g., Advil, Motrin) can help reduce the fever.  Adults can also use aspirin, but it should *not* be given to children with fevers due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.  Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids is also crucial.

It's important to consult a healthcare professional if a fever is persistent, high, or accompanied by other concerning symptoms. They can determine the cause of the fever and recommend the appropriate treatment.",0.7071,0.4865,0.1739,0.3243,9.1593
what's a heart attack ?,"Blood Flow to the Heart Is Blocked The heart works 24 hours a day, pumping oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the body. Blood is supplied to the heart through its coronary arteries. If a blood clot suddenly blocks a coronary artery, it cuts off most or all blood supply to the heart, and a heart attack results. If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the section of heart muscle begins to die. The more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the damage to the heart. Affects Both Men and Women Heart attacks are a leading killer of both men and women in the United States. Each year, more than one million people in the U.S. have a heart attack and about half of them die. Half of those who die do so within one hour of the start of symptoms and before reaching the hospital. The good news is that excellent treatments are available for heart attacks. These treatments can save lives and prevent disabilities. Prompt Treatment Is Important Heart attack treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur. Prompt treatment of a heart attack can help prevent or limit damage to the heart and prevent sudden death. Call 9-1-1 Right Away A heart attack is an emergency. Call 9-1-1 for an ambulance right away -- within 5 minutes -- if you think you or someone else may be having a heart attack. You also should call for help if your chest pain doesn't go away as it usually does when you take medicine prescribed for angina (chest pain). Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Emergency personnel in the ambulance can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. They carry drugs and equipment that can help your medical condition, including - oxygen   - aspirin to prevent further blood clotting   - heart medications, such as nitroglycerin   - pain relief treatments  - defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating.  oxygen aspirin to prevent further blood clotting heart medications, such as nitroglycerin pain relief treatments defibrillators that can restart the heart if it stops beating. If blood flow in the blocked artery can be restored quickly, permanent heart damage may be prevented. Yet, many people do not seek medical care for 2 hours or more after symptoms start.","A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is abruptly blocked, most often by a blood clot in a coronary artery.  This blockage deprives the heart muscle of oxygen and nutrients.  If blood flow isn't restored quickly, the affected portion of the heart muscle begins to die.  The longer the blockage persists without treatment, the greater the damage.

This definition aligns with the provided context, which emphasizes the blockage of coronary arteries by blood clots as the primary cause of heart attacks, and the importance of rapid treatment to minimize heart muscle damage.",0.7219,0.2691,0.1331,0.2008,6.4654
